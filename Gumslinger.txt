cxnverted_ 89 : i think this game is fun and enjoyable for most people like me, but maybe not for some people. i really like the game because of the funny jello-like appearance of the characters. i also enjoy the fact that there a a wide variety of characters and maps
einnad dannie : great glitchy game! fun as long as you believe it's multiplayer.... oh and hey the timer to open level 3 resets itself for me making it impossible to progress further... not much to say except it sucks !
daniel tarrant : it's really a great game. there are a lot of games that the creators list made for pocket money, but this game really had some thought put into it. great physics, slightly addicting, love it.
philip boyd : super fun! and no i was not paid to say this lol. this game is great. it is a little difficult to progress to different levels because of the amount of stars needed, but that just makes it a challenging game! i love it
samoht samoht : i think watching an ad to use the shotgun is a bit too much and that you can't go back levels but an overall fun game. thank you for responding. sounds promising.
david staley : editing my first review...still five stars. addicting. great time killer. ive been a gamer sice videogames were only in arcades, and the console t.v. game was pong. trust me when i say, nice game. fun to play. easy controls, graphics are great. sound effects, too. i recommend this game to everyone. 5 stars.
lord of the sith vader : this game is funny, silly, and enjoyable. the animation style is cool and different. one thing is that it's hard to know where your shot is going. but thats all everything else is cool.
ethan hartman : game would be worth it if it had real pvp, instead of pve falsely advertised as pvp because the ai is representative of another player's avatar. this means the gameplay is pretty hollow because everyround is against a calcluating ai that will eventually just aim lock you if you can't knock them out quick enough. the rng of the arena is just to cover up the fact every match is the same. this concept would be effective, if you were playing against an opponent in realtime.
combat chris : amazing game you guys are underrated and insane please make more games in the future.
genixio games : the game is terrible in every way, unbeatable ai that 1 shot u when u first start, no rewards unless u win the tournament, takes 10x the amount of bullets 2 kill than it does to kill u, u can only upgrade health which dosnt have an effect
notsogoodmeal 123 : this game was made for me, i love the simple graphics and the online duels. but i have some things i want in the game such as -gun skins -different guns such as rifle, sniper -maybe story mode or levels you have to get through -taunts and victory effects etc -minigames such as hunting -more maps like saloon, town, camp, mines -dynamite???
nitin kanwar : this is literally awesome! the graphics the music the duels everything is so great! it just wants you to play more and more. can't get enough of it!
master xyz : been playing this game for a couple days and had lots of fun, but since today it shows the loading screen and then it gets stuck on a screen with just the background color of the level i'm in (level 2). please fix it, can't play at all :(
brian : cute, but yet another game that should not allow the permission run at startup! one of a very few games i allow data with. cute, easy gameplay.
ramkrishna pandey : good game but can u make it more complicative its very easy to play i know its in casual category but it is way easier ,but belive me this game have a potential to beat mini malatia or even pubg ,its difficult but being more creative makes it more "want to play games" best of luck for further updates
oscar hit : really fun controls, definitely play if your looking for a fun game to play while your bored
shiney lehal : gave it 4 stars before, but i am enjoying it more now. i thought it was a cashgrab, but turns out that's not the case. good game.
ethan lavin : very fun game! you can tell the devlopers put q lot of effort into it and the result is great
shawn steward jr. : moving targets mode: ehhh, could definitely be better.... still a good game overall!!
cody feller : it's a really fun game and thanks for responding to my review and i understand now skill based matchmaking it's pretty cool
emillio garcia : its good but i hate it at the same time when ever you try to get the trophy why would you want us to do all of them
mario marquazz : can you make the gun skins free or cause in-game money i like the voice acting too good graphics this game is so freaking good
gemma del rosario : the sound is so cute but can you put game modes plsss 5 stars because i like the sound and the fps is like 1000 its soo antilaggy
daniel crawford : very fun, wish it wasn't so far in between new gumslingers, the further you get.
daniel : this is good game for anyone who likes candy and guns. which makes it perfect for me
pedro gonzalez : i reached 42 stars in level 1 and i didn't get to level 2 that's why i'm giving it 4 stars
joshua briseno : it is really fun to play offline and online i like the maps and the skins
scott golat : just a fun 5 second gummy splatting time. that turns into 30 minutes.....
jenelle liz : its really fun and there is some real players cool and bots if youre offline its very fun kinda looks like mm2
jimish shah : fun to play and engrossing edit: have finished all 30 levels. now what?!
shalom sims : just good ol fashioned rooting tootin shootin! nah but it's a pretty fun casual shooting game
cory c : fun game but you need to fix the stuff that gets in the way. its not needed on every duel, it makes it so there is no way one of the characters can hit the other.
fabrice ndiaye : great concept and gameplay! best game i've downloaded on the app store.
mark paradis : it's exciting, light and fun without being distastefully graphic
henry hill-liles : you need money to play the whole game like you get a tutorial and that's it i got no money to pay so
bonnie morgan : love this game. one problem, the reaper boss is too strong
joy martin : i truly love the game and i love the guns shotgun all day i love this game keep up the good work
naveen jestice : an amazingly fun mobile game that doesn't flood you with purchases and ads
alexandru iatan : i little bit violent but fun it has character and nice costume guns and skins
viraj singh : best game ever ! the graphics are the best graphics ever and it's free i love it i superbly recommend this i love it so much
isaiah tomoana : really cool game, honestly one of the only mobile games i kept on my phone and regularly come back too
aditi verma : good game ever played thanks for this game my son also like this game
eric_tha_ alien : the game is amazing and a good time killer it's fun and challenging and if you don't get pro ads don't pop up as much but i do wish they had more customizable options.
benjamin williamson : it's one of the only mobile games i actually enjoy! simple, fun, low on the constant advertising and asking to pay real money on everything. it runs well too, even in my crappy phone. it's great!
nick molchanov : that annoying pizza skills-shots while you are not allowed to miss even once and camera is not far enough to actually see where pizza is. oh, and that next-level-countdowns when you are no longer able to back to past challenges. and what should i do with my 30k while i've bought all gumslingers?.. but music and gameplay are fun.
hriotcthulhu : it's a pretty good game, i would like more ability to change colours of your gunslingers in the game with premium. also maybe add some more slingers. otherwise it's a great game and i love it
timo torres : it's a fun game i love this game of shooting and make more games and gunslinger is the best
damini jhawar : it's a nice game less ads graphics everything is good
arthur haleta : amazing game, with very few ads, which are also skippable. the graphics are great, i dont know what else to suggest, the game is perfect.
jay jones : this game is great! it's simple and so enjoyable. ads are minimal. what better way to pass the time and blow off some stress than slangin guns and ammo at candy figures. hats off to the creators. you guys nailed it right here ! download this app! you won't regret it!
fawzee emmamdeen : the best game i've played in a while! everything is spot on, the animations, the physics of the game, the music and little sounds, i love it! keep up the good stuffs
swarnali banerjee : just the game i needed. or anyone who likes arcade-genre games. superb graphics, cute characters and sounds, super satisfactory gameplay. it's a 10/10 from me.
lemon head : this game is kinda nice not like any game cause it can make fighting scenarios like i once fought a guy with gun he shot at me but i jumped behind the table and he jumped too put there were cliffs on the map and he graped the cliff and i all hail the king and shot him lol whatever but little gameplay with these scenes that you make up in your head are pretty cool so i think this what makes the game so neat and if you are reading this i think you should download the game
jasmine t : this game is a great time killer. it's fun, random and satisfying. especially, when you're having a bad day it feels good to shoot some jellies. the characters are colorful and silly. i think my favorite is mando who nuzzles baby yoda when he wins.
luke sunner : the graphics are brilliant along with the gameplay and there is a lot of variety. i wish there was an easier way to access the other guns. still a brilliant game.
mangles vlogs fnaf 2 : the game is good but at least make it where you can actually press the gun that you want to play as the entire game that you like and least add that to update 3 or 2 like elise make it a update where you could have pressed the shotgun and that would mean that you would have the shotgun the entire round so you don't have to worry about getting the pistol or something and there'd be a button cold random and it would randomize the guns make that an update please
sebastian spellman : this game is hilarious! you do not understand how happy i am that this game is being updated! the new bosses are fun and look great. hoping that more are added! there's so many things too do. you can get all skins, complete all the levels, grind bosses or just mess around with the loveable jelly fighters! developers, expect a donation
ivory sherrod : love the game and i thought i'd say it. however the shooting system allows for some odd moments where you shoot past the enemy.
sparko octavian : very stylish and cool game without pay to win and easy to control. a wonderful time killer, also offline. only i have a question: is it possible to play against friends? if not, will it be?
david p : no problems with it it's not pay to win it free fun and fair
brian lemus : this is a very fun game. i bought the most expensive go pro and i was not given what i bought. **update** the devolper got im touch with me and we talked about the issue. he was super helpful and showed me where i misunderstood. extremely happy now.
the pizza : fun game and very good art style the gameplay is amazing i would recommend
albie snyder : the game is a good concept but the controls are terrible. no matter how carefully you slide your finger the arm flys all over the place.
kyle anderson : i very rarely rate an app, much less a game, but the lack of frequent ads and having engaging gameplay and fun aesthetic makes this really worth downloading to pass time.
nick forsyth : game is awesome so far. love the smooth movement! gunplay seems great! great concept! need to find a way to battle friends in real time with betting on matches!
paul songer : absolutely phenomenal game. the ads are few and far between, which is the biggest reason i stuck around. the game is simple and fun, while still very challenging. i can't stop playing.
s.r. sarwono : the game is so buggy when you have reached the higher level. they make you lose the game on purpose, even if you shot at the enemy's weak point!
gerardo ibarra : awful collition detection, cool concept but could've been coded better. good if you're gonna play it like one time on a bus or something, not to keep for a long time.
michele barber : i love this game and i play it all the time.this game has a lot of characters and tons of levels and lots of things to do. i love all the gun skins, backgrounds, and all the challenges and levels.overall it is a great game and i recommend downloading it.
the flex : bro this game is aggrevating. the aiming, the props glitch, and the aim bot for the bots dude. especially when my enemy lays down behind a couch it wont let me shoot him anyway, but he shoots me headshot. this game really can get aggrevating even for my friends, im not hating i do like it (thats why im playing it) but it sometimes gets on my nerves
bobu : not a bad game but disappointed when i realised that the other players are just ai. as soon as i knew, it was obvious. wish that developers wouldn't fake games as multiplayer when they're not. i'm confused about all the super positive reviews for this game given that surely most people realise that the game isn't really multiplayer.
ramil roosileht : i like how simple the ui is and how arcadey the controls are. the game really doesn't ask a lot from you and is enjoyable to play in quick sessions.
miles_witha_ y : good game and concept but the whole reward system is confusing at first and then it just ends up to be not worth it. there are basically no rewards so no motivation to play this game
jedediah lewis : great game. original mechanics. awesome 3d graphics. well rendered. on my top ten list of games to download when i get a new phone.
koba giorgidze : very smooth, amazing graphics and awesom gameplay. its really good if you have no internet and your are bored. cute characters and etc. i hope this game wont die. thank you creators
adam forsell : funny, silly and challenging! i'm hooked it feels awesome to see your own progress by gaining better reflexes snd precision over time playing this!
peter dyers : this game is amazing, i've thoroughly enjoyed playing it! the developers should be so proud, the in game purchase aspect is well conceived and the game runs so smoothly and is so engaging. if the developers want to get in touch then please provide me with an email as i'd love to tell you more. best game on the play store!
wormillion ow : at first i pictured the best game from atari. remember that 2player shooter with random generated objects you could destroy if you didn't feel like trying to ricochet you shot? this was an opportunity wasted. oh well, maybe gunslinger2 will be better...
r s : good enough to spend a little money the portrait gaming people
roy dalio : great time waster! the controls are really fluid and once you get the hang of it it's fun! so much that i paid for pro and a paid skin can we play with friends please.
m : everytime i load in a game it show's up a ad when i go in 1 time, it does not appear and when i go in a second time, it show it up i hate ads, can u remove ads from the game because annoying and i will rate it 5 stars
martin kovachki : game is pretty polished and there's a lot to do. one huge downside is no realtime pvp. that is needed as soon as possible. i don't want to fight other players accounts on ai
oreo : it's a very nice game but i feel like it's missing something special.but if you could add like a aiming laser of some sort because the controls are a bit clumsy,otherwise great game.
barna hegyi : after i wanted to play the game for the second time it wouldn't load.i mean the logo and the audio is ok but after it loads to 100% on the top right it goes to a orangeish background and that's all...i tried to close the game and restart and to restart my phone but nothing...i actually liked the game and give a 5 star but whit this bug it's 1. i don't want to lose my 3 and a half hour of progress
autoaimbotboy : the game is fun but it's going a bit too hard whet the micro transaction. and of course it has it's fair share of bugs caus game is 3d but controls are made for 2d game.over all a relly fun game i enjoy playing it a lot.
cheerful hams : a great game but ads after every few games.
chillzentertainment : the tournament is rigged. headshots do lots of damage. i shot my enemy 6 times in the head and he shot me once in tge head and i lost. also, the timed sections are absurd.
kevin van der wal : seems like a fun game. not bad. i thought the menu and buttons to press in it were a bit user unfriendly. and it is pretty eager to show you paid features. but it isnt a bad game at all.
prodestroyer 4 : it is so good! i mean like the rag doll physics are just the best and after i got the shotgun i was like(0-0) it is op! and the different characters and skins add a whole new variety, i love it!
aiwais ali : hi, it is a great game, however, i purchased the pro mode, but i haven't received anything in return? the only thing that happened was the ads were removed. bit lost here, did the upgrade to pro not involve getting more skins or guns?
pete cheacker : luvly gelly fx but cheezy kiddy sfx, a very fun to play shootemup, cool random online competitors, weird weirdly weirdo wazzz!!!
oogabooga ookook : pay to use a gun or watch an add. aim a little high, even if it's just a slight change your shot is missed. need to wait an hour or more to move to the next rank. how shite is this.
iplayeverything : what a game. how did you get this idea? funtastic game. feedback: add more skins for characters, the gold skin for guns awesome. so add more skins for characters. by the way, i am a pro member now. thanks for the low price and onetime price instead of weekly, monthly recurring memebership. good luck for future updates.
blazzing_fire 34 : to describe what i think is a really good thing this game has wacky physics and it's fun to lose and win i'd say 100% without a doubt download it. it's very addictive and you might say mobile games aren't that good but this one is almost as good as fortnite and lots of people love fortnite it's as good as my fav game roblox the creators i appreciate how much time and effort you put in this game. after all i love cartoon violence and this brings it to a new level thank you !
kurt gam : super fake af! the game is alright so far, but the whole "pvp" is a lie. there is no multi player mode. the first game you play is training, no real players, okay fair enough, but from then on, the game just removes the "ai" from their names. example: [ai] jim ----> jim] there are no real players, i know this as fact because the enemy "player" never, ever draws their weapons before you do. i could go to sleep, and wake up with the ai still waiting for me to draw. also the game is laggy af.
paul johnson : could be a perfect 5 starts... - don't like the health system, should be full health/ fair for all each fight - can't stand the moving skill shoots, might be just me but i'll never get the bloody trophies
gabe johnson : awesome game! simple to play & very addicting! good job guys
pepe kube : so funny, so refreshing. i wish there was more games like this in the play store. you can easily tell that this game is actually well thought through and very well executed, can't quite recall when was the last time i felt so addicted to an android game. and i have to laugh at all those reviews saying "oh you need to spend money on this game". well guess what folks, the people developing these games actually have jobs and bills to pay too, yet you still want to enjoy their efforts for free? this one is definitely money well spent and i'm sure the fun won't stop anytime soon :)
epicman99 : the game is a funny idea, but it's wayy too hard, i found out that you need to spend currency to get full heal, i feel like this is a pay to win game... it's also really hard to aim, it's like snail racing, they keep beating me!
alfred john lomeda : really unfair and can't aim well
randomize person : it's fun, looks good, and i love the bouncy ragdoll physics. can get a little frustrating sometimes, but it might just be because i'm not that good at aiming. great job.
jad masri : i like the game, but it doesn't make sense that my hp remains the same across all the duels, unless i refill using 100 coins (2 ads to refill hp once) or of course, pay for it. bottom line is that it's indirectly a pay-to-win game, which i'll pass on..
reid clanton : once you get the aiming down it's pretty easy to hit the enemy then you just have to buy hit points and guns to win. pay to win game if you're cool with that.
jonathan schulz : very fun animations and sounds. simple premise, aim best but it's extremely entertaining with a ton of fun colorful characters and weapons.
bread cat : game itself is quite fun. but i'm only getting around 40-ish fps on a snapdragon 860 powered device, regardless of the graphical settings. update: no more frame rate issue. easy 5 star.
matthias beboux : very fun ! great idea, love the graphics, the sounds, and the "finishing moves / win gestures". even loosing get's me to smile or even laugh out loud.
toppycuppy : the game has really good graphics, i like that you can change the graphics but i have one concern i wish it had a gun aiming sensitivity but overall it's a really great game.
wombat steve : the game offered me multiplayer, google store says the this is an offline experience. google is correct, i turned my connection off and "multiplayer" works just fine. edit: thank you for the explanation!
derrick hall : its a very fun game to kill time. just wish you could get guns faster. but it makes the game fair, for when you play other people in tournaments though. well rounded game for having fun...
gio williams : supper fun and the guns are awesome and i love it.
clay wells : level 4 skillshot 2 is overly difficult in comparison to the rest of them which is incredibly frustrating. needs toned down. did you guys increase enemy damage and or decrease damage taken? went from decent tournament win rate to a win rate of 1-2 duels all the sudden. can't win a tournament even with a full health kit when i was winning them before with no health kit. this is my experience with all guns now. bleh
w. d. : this game rocks or jiggles. either way it's fun to play. wish there was a tournament for big rewards. like gun skins or special effects. can't wait for new upgrades. great job guys!
suraj mundhada : great game , but u should add multiplayer option for playing with friends... bluetooth or online connecting friends, tournament option for friends ... that will bring two more stars to the game
kyle vincent : this game is very well made the only thing i would add is a friend system so you can verse your friend (edit) i have just got a new phone and my pro membership has not been carried over if you could get it back that would be nice and i cant buy it again because i already have it so it would be nice to get it back
fearsomegem : the game is fun at first when your firing ai's but some levels in the torments are impossible you get knocked down if you get shot and there are rocks in the middle of the arena so when you get shot down and there's a rock you lose, ai's always do more damage
00 : thank you so much also plz add 2 players in one phone if u want to also i love your game keep it up also here is ideas for gumslinger arena mode is when 1 to 10 players 1v1 to see who's the last person standing and zombie mode is 1 player shooting zombies and have to battle level to levels and have to defeat all the zombies at the end the player have to battle a zombie boss.
somar alraheb : fun game! however, they should definitely add lan and online duels instead of just fighting bots. also, although you can get many different gumslingers for free, all skins are locked behind paywall, at least make a few of them purchasable through coins. i'll keep an eye on gumslinger in hopes of it reaching its true potential in pvp, not pvpb.
jordan : it's a fun game and well worth 0 yen. but i was sitting through ads thinking i had to be online to meet my next global opponent. some, by the way, had funky names. alas, i was saddened when i realized they were bots and i couldn't gum down real americans, sigh. lost a star for that.
m c : seemed fun at first but it's obvious that you're meant to pay in order to do anything other than first game mode. has potential to be fun but it gets boring fast unless you pay.
ciccioforchetta 88 : game is awesome, entertaining and simple, great graphics and barely any ad. only thing missing is the replay (with slowmo would be a 7 star game) of the actions pleeeease
carson shaffer : there is so much pay to win in this game that it is disgusting. you can't even unlock new guns without buying them. also don't get me started on the grammer issues throughout the entirity of the game. had potential and the developers got greedy.
leana : great but make it so when u shoot ur oppoment little bits of gum flys all over the place and i hate how u can't use a shotgun u have watch ads to use shotgun and sometimes the game will change my weapon to a revolver which sucks and the skill shot is so dumb because when u shoot something it goes through they can be pretty impossible sometime i don't know if u guys have actually tested the levels to see if they are possible
neel gohel : good game.. two things i missed in the game...1st..why dont you add local network multiplayer mode.. 2nd..please add to allow play with friends..with common platform using your own or using social media platforms.
memeious extremeious : the game itself is so damn fun to me, the physics, the sound, and the games art style are something to enjoy. those damn physics are something i tell ya.
jake benedict : its a quick fun game, but it really is just bots. when a duel starts, they only move after you touch the screen. they'll stand there as long as you will and never move a gummy muscle. for passing time, its great, but don't sell me a pvp dueling game and only put me against bots like so many other companies. its a shame.
jason higgins : i actually really like this game. i even paid for the pro version. unfortunately i have to give it a low rating because i've just discovered that pro only lasts for a couple of levels and then you have to pay again. i would suggest being up front about this. sadly, i will be uninstalling gumslinger. i will also remove rip from the same developer. i really don't like these tactics. update: the developer has listened to the complaints about upgrading to pro and has made changes. thank you!
paul ludwig : cool game and not a lot of ads!!
zuber : i have redmi k20 pro with 855 flagship processor. all games runs smoothly in my mobile. this is the first time, i am having a trouble playing a game. you need to fix the game it's laggy. otherwise it's great. please optimize the game as soon. as possible. it's so laggy
henrique peixoto : despite the paid content the game is awesome. it has simple, but very good graphics and the menus are easy to understand.
93gremlin93 : like the improvements but the daily reward system seems a bit counter intuitive. the first 6 days have a consistent avarage between 600 and 700 but the seventh day reward varies differently between 500,1000 and 1500. 1000 and 1500 makes sense but 500 is less that what i would get any other day. getting 500 after a week of logging in is rather demotivating if i can get more from loosing the streak
nathan tablet : pretty good, even though there's ads. i still like this
tyler o'donnell : great game, lots of potential but a few problems, like bullets passing through the enemy without dealing damage which seems to happen every dual
derp cwota : i liked the ads of this game cause they looked interesting but after playing the game i immediately give this game a 1 star because this game is super pay to win when you're in a with 64 and the numbers go down you will lose health and then the game will tell you to buy a health pack for 100 coins which is unfair since most of the people who get 1st place are pay to win noob's edit: ok after going back to the game it isnt that bad its just the massive p2w edit 2: now its going to a 2 star
ethan warren : i get the first shot off, man's half health on the ground, "easy win" i think to myself.boy was i wrong. so i empty my mag into his head as he is lying on the floor bleeding out.but to no avail, he somehow skillfully doges them all like neo from the matrix(all while on the ground).he quickly becomes tired of my futile efforts in killing him and simply shoots me in the head with the accuracy of a smart pistol off titanfall 2.the headshot damage at times seems too irregular, and am i facing bots?
3nvy b1ghungr33 : epic game... not sure what everybody else is talking about in their reviews this game does not lag and is actually really fun to play and i've leveled up very quickly i don't really understand why people are giving it bad reviews my only issues are i wish that there were more characters and that you didn't have to buy the pro version in order to unlock skins and other weapons permanently aside from that add more characters and guns please i think you're doing a great job
jayden plays : ok i will tell you what i think is wrong. the update said "use other guns for free" and i did not get anything. and that is the only problem was i being mean in the other one? if yes then i apologise. edit1: hi again. ok so someone had a revolver and shot me in the head and i died and when i got the game looking in the reviews you said two shots from a revolver is a knockout so i think a bug happened in the update.
adri : some maps are borderline unfair. why do i get spawned behind boxes with my head exposed while my enemy doesnt is beyond my comprehension. the jumping mechanics is borderline dumb since you cant control it. i lve lost multiple times because i autojumped into my enemys bullets that weren't supposed to hit me. health mechanic is just another cash grab. why do i need to waste money to get my health replenished?
sean vaughan : the game itself is alright the mechanics are good. but i don't like the fact you can only buy characters with the in-game currency. would think it would be better if there was more stuff to buy. e.g weapons. hats. gun skins, character skins.
nathan norwood : i love this game! it's funny, fun and competitive. i also love the animations.easy to learn controls but hard to master.
fizzy fox : amazing, original too i have never seen anything like this! um,i like the goofy movement when they jump,and how they talk can you add it where you can walk? just a bit sometimes you can get far away from your enemy.
ethan s. : the gameplay is good and fun, but the menus are so glitchy and most of the time get messed up, making me exit the game then come back.
flacid lemon : fun for about 5 minutes. feels like there is no skill involved since your bullets might randomly hit an object or you will be spawned behind an object that you can't shoot through, making you lose.
matt edie : great game! great graphics and game play. had an issue with previous purchase after i reset my device, and the dev was quick to respond and resolve the issue.
arden bien : this game seems dumb but when you start playing more it is very fun.
tyler habwe : one of the best duel games on the app store it's super funny the way the bullets bounce off of you. and the super skillshot it would be cool if you can get a dope skin
jonathan nava [johnmaster21] xd : very awesome game! i actually first had my doubts about this game. later, as i kept playing i hooked on. nice graphics and pretty funny gameplay. although they could have added a multiplayer showdown like "bowmasters" but it gets it's five stars
daniel burt : incredible. i never review games, but this one is totally unique. the sound design and soundtrack alone are worth it! and the game is tons of fun.
abdulaziz : amazing game but it has a bug: when two people fall at the same time the "refill medkit to duel with full health bar" option doesn't appear. please fix it
luciano musella : excellent gameplay and polish, the only issue is that it's p2w, not by a lot, but it is unfortunately. still fun for a couple of matches with the fake players.
anindya sur : great game, some save flaws. got to level 3 and then the game did a full wipe sending me back to the the start screen. is there a way to bring back my progress?
visalam m : honestly, this game is so underrated. it's funny, it's good. the characters, soundtracks it's all pure fun. compact size, online game. graphics is cartoony, and entertaining. very unique game with its own territory.
baharuddin maghfur : very good. little add
ant corona : this game is not online reason 1 you can pause the game in online games you can't pause online games second reason ads in middle of fights online games can't have that and third reason: unranked people having new skins and other guns and things that you need levels for and yes i know you can buy them but them having rare skins are obviously bots
oompa loompa : others than the somewhat kinda glitchy physics (it only glitches sometimes and very rarely and it won't shoot sometimes but that might just be my phone) it's a really good game.
jeffery van williams : extremely well executed. higher than normal quality production. ingenuity : 8/10 polish: 7/10 physics: 9/10 adfckery annoyance: 3/10 (10 being most annoying) worth trying , if only because i actually was pretty good at this from match number 1, so , maybe i'll see ya in the game, pardner... this is a fun game. not too ad annoying . dc heavy & for real cash, daddio... careful!
eric walker : very fun game and very addicting. a lot of people complain about having to watch ads, which are short and not very frequent. the makers of this game need to make a living and the game is well worth a few short ads here and there. you are not entitled to free entertainment, so suck it up and have fun.
kanaga selvi : this game is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo amazing and the graphics are sooooo good i highly recommend this game but i already have found a glitch when both the player dies in offline mode i win and in the next round a glitch strucked the game and i dide when i spawn and in ultra graphics on searching players is down a little bit...
daniel shatters : it's pretty fun an the characters sounds awesome and the movement when you get shot an stuff is cool. massive amount of guns and characters. the two i liked the best were good star wars character from attack of clones, and cthulhu.
ynut lopez : its a really good game but they should maybe add a story mode and maybe upgrade weopons and some taunts like and different maps like day time,night time, and maybe some ablities you could use thats all i have to say i really like this game.
fett_collects19 : such a simple and fun game! love the style and how you can just easily play short matches whenever you have any spare time on your hands! excellent!
gagan basra : i wrote a review before but i said something wrong it's not the gunslinger challenge it was the super skillshot challenge so all i got from this challenge was 100 gold it says you get something awesome but all i got was 100 gold. i don't know if this is a bug or not please reply and if it's not a bug you guys really need to fix the prize it was not worth my time i did the challenge twice to see but i only got 100 gold the first time and the second i got nothing
devin venne : it's a pretty fun game at first. but the more i play the more my bullets somehow go straight through enemies without doing damage. a wonky mechanic tbh.
unicycle boi : i somewhat liked this game but the thing that annoys me is it says it os multiplayer yet the tags for the game are offline and singleplayer. i read responses from devs about multiplayer and they say it is supposed to be a ghost of the player with the same skill level. this would require a advanced self-learning ai and it is practically impossible to measure the skill level in this game. i hate when these games try to make you think your playing multiplyr. just admit to having normal ai's
 : i bought the pro version. everything is cool but phone runs slow on skillshots. please fix this. my graphic settings are low. thank you for response.
adnan hammoud : its simplicity makes it very engaging and addictive. i wish i can play against friends though i'm not sure if you can or if its something i need to unlock. great game!
gavin peterson : this game is trash. no health regen between rounds and it costs 100 to refill your health? and winning the tournament only gives you 150? no matter how good or fast you are you're going to take damage at least a few of the rounds meaning you have to grind out a few stars at a time unless you want to pay them real money to actually have a fair shot at winning. what a scam. i can't believe this game is rated as high as it is, it's a cash grab.
y75r : this is one of the best games ever!!! i have played for just 3 days and its so captivating! its silly and fun, i hope there will be many more updates, and can people give ideas for new gums? it could be a great way to implement fan made things in game!
iman dashto : i love the game but the one where you shoot the can in the air 3 times is impossible if you shoot it two or one time it flys away in to the distance so to make that not happen add a wall to prevent it not to happen
cheese : this game is a lot of fun and was a great surprise. i do wish once the level timer began i wasn't forced to abandon the remaining stars unless i played a lot then.
skin and bones : i love this game and it is simple. if you are the person that plays simple games you have to get this one! all i think the developers should do is make the bosses a little easier. great game
michael wilber : really fun to play. definitely two thumbs up
shane tobin : it's good game quite hard at times. i gave 4* because i dont believe it's actually online players u play all time think its computer also having to pay for designer guns unless u win just normal ones. not many ads to.
xillo : this game is fun, the gunplay is snappy and it has a fun visual style. but your multiplayer is absolutely fake. you aren't fooling me, not once do you ever fight a human opponent.
luca_ dovekendall : for stuck in lockdown and most phone games played i have been endlessly looking for something to play and this popped up. at first i thought it was a one time thing but really it's the best game for lockdown. signed prefectpizza
cs16 : this game is amazing it really has improved the controlls are kinda the same and everything else has improved so much! but the only problem is the ai's can get overpowered guns that are one tap to the head overall this game is cool
jonah warren : the gameplay is great but not being able to return to levels and complete the trophies makes the game completely unplayable for me.
sam yeates : really fun, simple game. despite simple premise, lots of play time. free version is very playable, ads are not too frequent. i got the pro version because i enjoyed it so much!
vishesh saxena : nice game, quite addictive, creative, but it get laggy a time , i don't why ,may be bcz of server, and few areas are quite biased to opponents especially the cliff one , try to fix them ...
magolore : the game is very good but i keep experiencing a bug. mostly every single time i play the game it just crashes. please fix this.
ruzantsu : this game opens and loads but then it's a blank screen for a long time and i keep rebooting it till it miraculously works. i hate having to do it everytime.(from my oneplus 6)
filimon alvarez : this game is amazing! good quality, easy controls and realy run to play. something i do wish though is a multiplayer mode and friends so i can add poeple. also can u guys add a online mode?
dustin zhang : watching ads, but no golds rewards from mission.
sushila adhikari : this is gumazing game it is a good time passer even the bots act like real humans so it is challenging many people say that it is bad that you need money to heal just go and win some matches and it will be super easy you need to heal a lot because you are not good but you can win also. like other games it does not force you to pay it is optional and you know even the developers need money anyway very good game
weldon braud : the physics aren't perfect and where the gummuys are placed on the field isn't always fair, but that also adds to the entertainment at times.
mali : despite being called, "gunslinger," it's actually no that violent, and very fun! one small glitch, i can sometime glitch out of the room/level and i have to reboot the game. plz fix
zachary dziedzic : the load times after and between each duel is way longer than the actual duel. don't get this game unless you enjoy frustratedly tapping the screen trying to skip useless info and little character dances
kafka frate : really fun game and fast to play. but you have to aim for the head if you wanna eliminate faster your opponent. the jelly makes it even more fun :)
mr. tommy : super fun great game but there's a lot of thing ads
anthony cordio : pretty fun game! different concept.
hanz louie upao : there are no endless and multiplayer mode only death match , if you die revive ,. it needs to update now to be easy mode hard, medium and impossible mode to play and with bonus. to play it need to now name to play.......
francisci guardado : i like this game a lot but the thing i hate the most is the falling off the map and you can't dodge the bullets so it a two star and i hate that you cant buy guns with the coins you earn in the game
grant garcelon : its nice to see a game where there was obviously a lot of effort that went into making it. play this game instead of those trash games that all use the same engine, spam you with ads and take a weekend for the devs to make.
milan patel : this game is very fun to play. i enjoy it but you could add the movement or maybe just add the jump and duck button which will improve the overall gameplay.
spookibatgaming : there are a ton of levels that start you right against the edge of the map but your opponent is no where near it so it's an easy with for them.
isaac skinner : a beautiful game! the physics look so good, and the graphics are kept simple. it's not pay to play, it requires actual skill, and is addicting. 10/10
metamorphic : this game asks you to spend hard earned currency between tournament rounds and then randomly spawns you wherever it wants. to pay to have full hp for the next round and then get spawned on a crate where 1 shot will knock me off and kill me is infuriating. skill doesn't matter, i can get a perfect headshot and then get knocked off by a poorly aimed belt shot. this game is terribly designed and it's physics and silly game play are wasted by the poor game design they are built on, wish i could 0/5
isaiah - : you have to watch ads in order to play with guns you unlock. i like the game, but cmon really? all that time i put into trying to unlock some stuff only to be told i have to watch ads or purchase "pro" to use them.
noah reaves : freaking pissed off, can even tap to shoot, all i can do is aim and die...not to mention my bot opponent had a racial named slur!
mochammad rachka : please, make some real challenging. i mean, player v player (realtime-online). trust me, if this thing you (itatake) work on it, lt will be more interesting. i'll be invite much friend to play this game. overall, not bad, good work. g'luck! i'll be waiting for it.
daniel huertas : it is truly a complete shame as great as this game is the software makers cannot make levels fast enough. the game loses complete interest when you're playing most tournaments against ai.
taichi favio yoshida inoue : the game is so fun and simple. you can keep playing this game week after week and never get boring. just one thing i would like that the team can improve is that you can play with your friend or make your own tournament to play with they.
aaron gering : i absolutely love this game. had to remove ads for a small fee but worth it. dig the graphics and easy to use interface. i recommend it.
tr4shpanda : it's really fun and for a mobile game it is well put but there are a few downs like it shows zero health but there still alive but that's really it its really addictive and fun you should try it out :) barely any ads no pay to win just clean fun needs a 5.0 love it and enjoy it soooo much :) :) :) :) :)
jaxon : with a cast of quirky characters and hilarious clint eastwood-esque duels, gumslinger has to be one of the best pvp(b) games out there. i strongly recommend this game for a test of muscle memory, speed, and accuracy.
kafka emon : fun gameplay and addictive. but very high price to go pro and there is no cheaper ad removal (only) option. and except revolver & shotgun most of the guns are less interesting or boring.
julian ramirez : it's frustrating when you first start but once you get used to the controls it's so easy i love it it's amazing if you're looking for a game for kids to play so they're distracted for a while this is a good game two
aditya jadhav : the game is pretty great and a little bit addictive and in app purchases are pretty cheap which i like in a game as casual as this and love that the game doesn't spam you with constant buying ads.
rileyoregon812 : take out the levels where you come out of nowhere they're so db. the skeet shooting is also annoying when going for the trophy.
ilmi haqim : a masterpiece of a casual game. add pvp and it'll be perfect. the spawns are sometimes unfair but hey it's fun. itake, can you make a gladiator theme game like gumslinger but with melee weapons. just a suggestion
seer gredic : the game of really fun but i need to be multiplayer or i might delete it i love the game but but it must be whoever made the game you to put multiplayer on it make sure make sure you can download on computer or pc thank you for making the game for all people down by until i download the game it really funny and and making me happy thank you so much bye-bye
matthew gill : fun game. overly complex system for rewards etc.... rather just shoot stuff. but good enough that i paid to remove the ads!
harshil modi : good game!! 3 stars because for free to play players have to watch that ** ad before entering the tournament. and that "gun slinger" screen takes more time to load than it should be. else it deserves 4-5 stars.
ack aine : its an epic quest, awesome levels and bosses along with levels. truly creative and goofy totally worth playing.
eric martinez : ok this game is good. the thing i like is that they give a daily gift i got a skin they should ad buttons to shoot and aim and a two player like to do like a vs with your friend. thank you
maydi golindano : great and epic game! this game is so good. i love the concept of instead of normal people it's like gummies instead. i also like how there is so many characters to chose from! this game is one of the best gun games out there! thank you for this game.
kingkuk 77 : a very fun silly game, and i had a blast playing it and getting all the characters and guns. would definitely recommend to anyone.
estevan silva : first of all the ai always have a better andvatage becasue the ai are in the middle of the map while im on the edge one bullet that hits me im going off the map.and sometimes they still hit head shot even do they hit me somewhere alse the game is pretty fun but these need to get fix becauese it ois very annoying.
rock alexander : first game i've played like this! hella fun with pretty tough challenges but doable once you get the hang of it! overall great!
abhijit mhasagar : the opponent kill me only in 2shot even after i hit him 5 shots still he was standing
aj : fun game but why the fake multiplayer? if you play with internet the names change from having ai in them but they're still very obviously ai. the only reason i can see for having internet in the "online" match is so that you could get the ads edit from 3 stars to 2: you lie in the description about it being online
neal kaplan : deceptively addicting. didn't know i'd get so sucked into this. i think it's the fact that the quick tourny style duels gets the competitive juices flowing so that it gives you a steady dopamine drip of cartoon style gun pleasure. don't know what if that makes any sense but i highly approve of this game. simply a joy to play
pizza crust : this is the most fun game i've played that's got guns cartoony graphics and all(i don't play fortnite that's why) i'm amazed :) this game is so well made i now have alot of the characters im trying to get venus flytrap...but i would love if the gun skins didnt cost money because i vant afford them and they look cool, thank you
scrapy yt : (real person)great game it has wacky and fun mechanics but the reason for 4 stars is it always puts the same advertisement for some pro pack. i forgot what it was called but overall it's a pretty good game. one day i would like to make a game like this.
pablo lopez : i like the game but one thing that they could fix is earning the gun skins and not have to buy them. $0.99 is a good price but still it would be a lot better if you could earn the gun skins and not have to buy them. soo thats why i rate this game a four star rating.
caleb cepeda : i think that the game is great and you should download it right now if you are still reading this congrats you get a little invisible trophy that is pointless
kivanc tek : it is so good sometimes but mostly it is the worst game i have ever seen. it says you are playing with other played but you are not. also, it want you to watch a video for play with other guns. you can just use one gun without watching a video.
soloaztec : great game! just a lot of ads.
gaspachio donatelli : super fun progression, and i love how you really need skill to win instead of pay to win like most app games. i just wish you could add more personality without paying like adding unique color schemes or co cop missions for friends.
jayden james : this game is very engaging,i downloaded and played this game for a fun ragdollish game,meanwhile it's a very engaging and quite frankly stupid game,it's controls are horrible,and if you can never win,i literally can't even win my 1st tournament,it's too hard,and it's annoying.
hollis laskey : love the game, my only grievance is that in order to use guns other than the basic one, you have to either watch ads to fill them with ammo temporarily or purchase the "pro" version of the game.
sudip kr. dey : its nice concept and fun to play.....i also buy the offer but there is a problem in a specific match where the health is can't restored it said that have yo pay 100 so to refill it and another thing is that the opponent has a more powerful gun than me which cause to me for defeat......
christopher storm : game can be frustrating at times. shoot an opponent 5 times including headshots, but he shoots you once and he wins. needs work.
noyb noyb : it glitches and its way too hard because it should put us at someone with the same level and they should put it at random guns for any even if you don't have this gun or that one because some people will just have a revolver every single time and others will have a legendary one or cool one that does enormous damage!!!!
ben sotheran : its just fun.good ti pass time and cure boredom.
ayushmaan's earth : amazing game its actually a shooting game i like there are many reasons why it's my favorite well first of all it isn't a pay to win well i guess it isn't 100% pay to win because characters do have different traits and also this game has put this satisfying feeling whenever i win i have a very good feeling cuz i clutched and beat them, no game has ever been able to bring that out of me since 2017 and there are many other reasons why it's a good game but no space to write them so i recommend
lisa walsh : love this game! graphics are kinda goofy but well done at the same time. game play is accurate and really entertaining, would definitely recommend this game to anyone, any age. nice job folks. i look forward to seeing more game's from you.
jason mclane : it increases my heart rate. lots of fun. and after 2 weeks, i'm still playing & enjoying it. it is a challenge. it's been 7 months since i began playing and it is still lots of fun. i highly recommend this to anyone.
nachogaming macho : best game ever played!!!! i love the lobster sheriff character. awesome !!!!!!!!
prithvi krishnan : pretty fun game, even though the sole purpose is to only duel, the game doesn't even get boring... what i feel should be improved is that the fps because it drops so much that quick drawing becomes a bit difficult, and the bots should be more stronger too...
kyron plays : this is a very cool game and i highly recommend it if you like shooting games and want to play multiplayer and the items in the shop are fairly priced so i am going to give 5 stars
yee old goat : honestly, good game, haven't.been seeing that many ads, overall design is great, and the concept is actually really cool. good job!
damindu dilsara hettiarachchi : i've been searching the whole store for a fun, time killer and this was epic for that. amazing graphics and easy controlls. one of my favourites so far.
michael dean popp : loved the game, would have gotten 4 stars do to the fact its kinda the same thing over and over but it lost the second star when it introduced the crossbow, they seriously screwed the pooch on this one. it doesn't fire the same distance everything there is no rime or reason to it just dumb.
john natale : great game that's actually free to play and doesn't bombard you with adds. really smooth and easy controls. i love it.
chrisjoe015 : love the game. fun characters and vivid colors bringing the game to life. very addicting with challenges to pass and daily reward to receive.
sidharth : not able to choose guns...no matter how many times i tap on shotgun it reverts back to revolver in every other game..give an option to tick and choose the gun just like we can choose the gumslinger
logan hysell : very fun and easy to learn game
mrstormx : good game but it got bored easily... i hope you can add multiplayer mode with different modes in it... and i very recommend this game has a battle royale cause that will make the game more awesome and fun. btw i really satisfied with the creative characters... good job
silas : the controls are simple and fun, the graphics style is awesome, the game is fun and has a neat level up system that makes sure you never get bored
nosacrality : would be fun if it were actually online. you gave ai names that real people would choose, and you even put the name "n****r". you can sit for hours, and your opponent will never draw their gun before you. they only draw the second you put your finger on the screen, like it knew you even placed it there before you moved
jason ortiz : fun game challenging players and challenges. i like it good pass time game. graphics are good and controls are simple.
sherif elnayad : this game is just awesome , love the idea and it is executed perfectly , ads arent many , i would love to see more customization like changing colors of gumslinger , adding accessories etc
rafy : i love this game is so fun but me and my friends would really appreciate a online multiplier system so me and my friends can play together for example me can friend each other with a friend code and play matches against each other other tha that this game is really good one of the best phone apps and i have purchased pro and do not regret thank you for this game!!
deon eisara williams : the game is really good but when i'm playing it it doesn't it make me want your ads every time and i don't like it but i die when the ads over
kingsveniboy : absolutely love it, it's a great time waster, the graphics are dope and the gameplay is just outstanding. keep up the good work!
harsh rajpurohit : love the ragdoll physics and occasional jump that the character do to reduce the distance between the opponent. really a game worth playing!
brandon bushell : one of the best games i have ever played for multiple reasons. very few ads, lots of content and a very fun art style. one of the very few gems in the play store.
steve gentry : enjoy it... okay, i stopped playing for a while, re-installed on a different phone, and for whatever reason, i cannot log in on google play, so all my purchases, progress, etc... is gone?!? surely you have a contingency for this, eh? you'll get your stars back, when i get my time back...
pineapple gaming : i love it. it's basically gummies that shoot guns. it's pretty child friendly as it doesn't have violence other than a gun. 5/5 amazing game. i've tried so many games and this one is honestly fun and enjoyable
faridah daud : this game is awesome!!!!!pretty hard to control but thats fine!!!graphics also awesome!!!i won my fist tournament and it encouraged me to continue the journey.i also searching this game the whole noght because i forgot the title.and i find this game.this game is cool really recommended to everyone!!!!!
pillowcow2010 : i think it is a good game to play, highly recommend. i had no problems whatsoever.
a gleason : good game but maps are a little not fair at times. also being able to shoot more times then you should on the ground gets annoying.
gamer208 playz : it's so hard the second level for level 1 is so hard becuase of the last part of it becuase you got to get 3 stars on the last one and you cant do that inless you can hit all the bottles that they throw at you dont get it
caleb holliday : it seemed like a fun game but the flinging and jumping is to difficult to aim. and when you jump over things you tend to fall over and they absolutely decimate you.
william teeter : fun, a few adds but otherwise near perfect
faerhazar : its really great. its got some good visual humor and is fun to play, but its a little slow, progress wise.
gabriel : i don't know why, but this game is so fun i can't believe it, maybe i'm crazy. and if feels so innocent shooting gumballs with real weapons it's not even real. please add more character customization options.
smord : great game. clever system: you fight against ai but the "gumslingers" you fight against are owned by players. so it is pvp but you'll never have the problem of not being able to get into duels. your slingers earn you in-game currency by fighting even when you're not playing yourself. easy to play, very funny and quite addictive. 5*
winzo agent : awesome game, great concept, just wish it was real time multiplayer, want to play it with my friends.
melissa ahern : worst god dam game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it doesnt even let you play the god dam game once the tutorial is over you cant do anything else dont recommend any more but i also defo dont recommend for people like me who gets mad at something easily
legendary llama : very fun game.a little dumb sometimes,but it is fun
robert ferris : very fun competitive gun battle game. easy controls and few ads. like to turn up the volume to hear guns roar. highly recomend.
zander morris : this game is a lot of fun. i quite enjoy playing it, but there is one small thing i find annoying. i wish you could earn weapon skins from stars, and not have to to pay a dollar for each weapon skin. other than that, nice job devs.
jonathan spence : i hate that you gotta pay for 'medkits', which if you don't have, its impossible to get further than the second or so stage. uninstalled. edit: xd and you get a whole two coins with each win? suuuure, lemme just do 50 rounds and eventually get one medkit
x29doomsday : this is a great game i love the diifferent challenges and weapons espeicaly the shotgun. things i want to see added are snipers rocket launchers 2v2 game modes. overall its a great free game with across the world tournaments great skins. great game u guys did a great job with this amazing game
jovis joseph : really fun idea. but once you realise that you are playing with bots the fun just goes away. they say it's pvpb (i guess it's player vs player bots). i've never heard of such an abbreviation even i searched in internet and found nothing. i think they are trying to decieve us by using a similar abbreviation to pvp. if it was a real pvp it would have been a great game.. but its a good game to play once thou even if you are playing with bots
jakub juchum : haven't got too far, but it's a nice distraction. the only thing - on level 1 there was an hourglass and i was supposed to finish within 2 hours. i did and nothing happened. no idea what was that about :-p
aleksandar komazec : it is a great idea, but i gave you 1 beacuse you scam people showing layout " finding opponents". this is not an online game, and there is even no match making. this is just a single player game with bots, but wrapped as a multi player. stop scamming people and you will get 5 stars. five stars, i have assured in you words. go ahead
fernando tafoya : i really liked this game it dose not have much ads
tinybigeyese : these are some really fun gummy gum jelly gumslingers the game runs very bad though
vale tattoo : one of the best games i've played on the phone. 4 stars because there is no store in game to buy cosmetic things from points earned by playing. if you want skin, you have to pay money..
peter hayes : just an insane amount of fun from such a simple concept. delightfully executed. pop culture references abound.
rachel verburg : a great great game. one think i'd like for the future is being able to play against or with yoyr friends.
theplopper : i really like this game. i like how each character is special and not just a cosmetic. one idea, please add more updates to the pass to make it more valuable. i'd like to see what you guys will do to the game in the future. (:
michael : good job keep it up. i think you should shorten the ranks because it is really hard to get there. i think maybe a little shorter or maybe you should add that we can buy guns instead of waiting. thank you for the feedback.
tdeepweb : some maps are based on lucks but not pure skills. you either got fling away or fell down the map without getting hit! btw, i love ragdoll game but im giving it 1 stars since it is giving me triggers instead of comedy even though it is a ragdoll game.
father stick : fun, addictive, easy to play, and win. fast paced, challenging, well put together, fun and loveable, cruel and punishing. this game is a blast to play, and looks even better.
certified b r u h : it's a fun game but the reason i rate it 1 is because i bought the pro version and gold and ray skins then all my progress rested. i was scammed out of my money, if this was a glitch please fix it. i want a refund or give me the stuff i payed for, thank you.
iam karma : this game sucks its absolutely terrible it puts you on barrels and you instantly get shot off the map and lose and the aiming mechanics are trash
bud ani : fantastic game you can play for free, no pay wall to progress.. this is how games should be glad to see the developers keeping it old-school and not forcing in app purchases to progress through the game.. played for 4 days before i chose to support these awesome developers!!
kermit soldier : this game is really fun but when you add friends and battle them its just an ai that has the same name and skin as your friend
capalot kelley : it's it's very badly designed game. it's legit so frustrating
cherish sita ayu : the character are cute and this is a good game. thanks
eben beukes : this game is sooooooo addictive and fun!! a game i always wanted. if there is one thing that would make this game epic would be a slow motion replay or slowmo mode. but otherwise this game is awesome!
neil conde : great game defently needs more respect love the gummys just make the splatters for coins
maria fernandez : it was great i liked it very much and can't wait for updates keep it going
fred mit : this game is so much fun it's funny western style and you can get new guns and beat bosses different gummy slingers i recommend this game to people who like shooting action games
james whitelock : graphics are very good
tammy blackard : i liked it the way it was before!!!!
zedd : unskipable ads, enhanced so that the exit button is out of reach, this is the mobile industry doing anything in their power for an extra penny
adrian yee : refreshing. happy even when losing.
axxel lepage : amazing game one of my favorite games
weston crowe : fun and enjoyable
samir faraz : crazy, weird and fun!!
qrispy godtv : fun and kills time for real
ixde : can't out ad
leena tak : good game but full of bots
gael de la pena : so good and funny'
aek teeyapanit : this is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hussain ch : fun to play game
ian reynante : nice grapich and game 5555
gaurav singh : very interesting game
karl fuentes : i can't 1v1 with my friend on real time
brett heinrich : it's really good i like it.
evin ervian : most of it is fun
damien smith : good time killer if ure waiting to clock into work or just casually gaming
murdoch ruffin : i recommend this game because it challenges you and you can battle others
area1 : worst experience . really hated it
gabe perez : it's really fun. the physics are goofy and amusing. the leveling is challenging but it's not pay to win which is always amazing.
general yosif : it's still bad, i am sorry. this has a potential to be something bigger and not a mobile game. also, it didn't give me my little progress i had when i signed in with google again and this is veeeery bad. imagine i had a lot of progress, change my phone, install the game back on it only to realize i haven't even finished the tutorial. the game just isn't good in general. it is just pointing and shooting. it needs more. that is why i said it can become something big.
travengamer : i think the controls are way too hard and it was lagging 50 percent of the time. i also hate it when one of the characters is behind cover and you are right in the open
rocky gonzalez : good game play. however, i only got to play for a while due to the really raunchy add that popped up. i was offended i had to uninstall the game quick! looks like some type of sex trafficking going on. someone should check on that.
matthew foss : it's really fun. it would be cool if there was a replay after each match, like a slowmo killshot or something.
michael glicas : i love this game. the physics are really cool and the gummy body of your character is bouncy and funny. i think it has improved since the last reviews i've read. its fun now and i'm really good at it.
dave gschwind : newest update does fix the framerate issue, stabilized into a playable framerate, 20-30ish. still takes some time to reach 120 fps. thanks devs! keep it up
devam bansal : great game. could be more fun if they added walking, manual jumping and long range fights. maybe with fully player aspects.
adarsh singh gautam : gameplay is very addictive and fun but main ui is little bit confusing like how to continue further in game. would like to see a update for that. cheers.
mark rush : its ok...seems so random tho who wins the duels...you dont ever seem to increase you skills because you can be shot dead in an instant or you might win a tournament...its random either way it seems.
robbie hall : i enjoyed it at first, but eventually the balancing issues killed it for me. don't even try to tell me that a grenade launcher that can one-shot kill is balanced. 4 stars if you fix this.
max merra : its a good game, but its really dumb that you keep your health from the last match amd then get the option to regen it with coins. its pay to win and thats really annoying.
nickolas martinez : great time killer, simple dueling game play with extra game modes throughout levels and tons of cosmetics with semi fair pricing. overall surprisingly fun.
jeremiah shewcraft : fun, quirky, and short game sessions make this a plus in my book. plenty of unlockables and replay value. overall, recommended.
frank bell : originally gave this game five stars until one day i opened it and i was back to level one with a laggy game that couldn't even be played.
badrobtheboss : love this game. barely any ads, lots of fun gameplay, i think the skillshots are a little difficult but after some attempts i can pass them
jack cartee : perfect old west meets candyland shooter. also doesn't bombard you with ads. and you can rank up without paying a fortune, because skill matters.
maaz sheikh : i thought this app would be bad but when i download it i instantly got addicted to it
mr. monkey : this game is garbage. when you get closer to level 2 in it your no longer able to fire your gun. it's a waste of space and should not be on the playstore.
felix kim : sucks. it is almost impossible to beat the easiest level how am i suppose to have fun with this if i lose every single time!? this game is ridiculous and whoever the creater was did a terrible job on adjusting the level difficulty.
loch nessie9 : overall, i enjoy the app and it is an easy way to kill a few moments in between doing things. it's fun and visually nice to look at.
kayla williams : it's so good cuz you get to customize as much as you want to collect daily awards and they look really cute and you can upgrade your characters you should download it to i think you have a better time
michael strantzalis : great idea, nice mechanics and beautiful graphics. and most importantly, few and non intrusive ads! great job! keep up ;)
5kull ca7 : one of the best/simpliest mobile games i've played. it has a good artstyle and clean ui with simple yet addictive gameplay! its satisfying seeing the goofy gummi guys ragdoll as you struggle to aim and shoot. good time
just a lemon : love it and i would like to give u some new ideas such as making it a lan-game (or offline multipkayer game) where they can battle each other or make a coop version where both of them are surrounded by gumbies (zombies) =) , thank you for responding =)
zachary desaine : the game was quite fun from my perspective,the ragdoll effects and action with the maps but i do wish there was a bigger range of weapons to use.
hell lord : pay to win app the med are too expensive. and the way some map are designed are unfair. and half the time when you knock someone out they are are knocked out forever. and they can shoot when knocked out it's hard while shoot them while they are knocked down because of the shrink in size.
brandon carman : great game, but there has been a couple times where i quick draw someone in the head, and it does no damage at all. i'm only experiencing this with the shotgun.
jaiden keene : good game. broke after a while. uninstalled reinstalled and lost some progress. however i did lose my pro so a restore purchases option would be cool.
andries esterhuizen : this game is pretty simple on the surface, but the amount of small details and the physics makes this game so much fun. really great job team, something to be extremely proud of!
rule britannia : wouldn't even open. i tried tons of times, with the internet on and off. it just froze the second it began, crashing my whole phone.
dark link 64 : good time killer, and a good game all around. a gummy version of red dead redemption, but only the quickdraw parts.
andrew ritfeld : fun game with great visuals. wish it had a replay option so i could rewatch the duels in slow mo and different angles.
spoodermn 21 : very very fun. i have some frame drops sometimes but i can deal with it. no pay to win elements or microtransactions shoved in your face. very good job.
martyn daines : idea for the game is good. but having to spend credits to heal between tournament duels leaves you at a serious disadvantage. after just 10 minutes you know only people who pour money into this game will benefit, so uninstalled.
z bug : ok so i have two suggestions 1. lower the price on the health kit i would say $15 2. have the option to play offline. and another thing evey singel time at the end of the tournament no matter where you hit them they will never die.
rush e : good game, but i could already tell this game was like all the others when i saw pay for full hp. i shouldn't need to pay for full hp in any game. that would give my opponent who didn't get hit a single time a advantage.
dk_phoenix : one of the worst and most boring games i've ever played. not to mention the games are all rigged. the other character is able to jump around like an effing kangaroo while im bound to the ground and cant move.
rory platt : so far, great game! $1.99 is a great price to pay for pro and to lose the ads. good fun for a quick timewaster.
ameer saib : this game is awesome, it's loads of fun to play, i could almost say it is addictive. i hope in future updates we will be able to have shootouts with specific friends.
kyle king : it's challenging and fun but the super skills shots are dumb 1% people finished it more like none since the can flys off the screen after the second shot
ayush sarkar : amazing tactical shooter game with mind blowing graphics and wobbly body ragdoll physics.moreover the gameplay is very addictive with tons of guns and characters to play with.it runs very smoothly in my six months purchased redmi note 7 pro which is an awesome mobile phone.deserves 5 stars , nothing less than that.love it.
bill the first : i loved it and ive got an idea for a new game mode. perhaps you could have the two duelists given the ability to duck behind some kind of desrructable cover instead of just stand out in the open.#notabot
sam jones : update 6/27/2020 - different guns are free to use! my only complaint has been fixed! this game is a ton of fun, but i would recommend this game just on the fact that the developers are so responsive. this game will only improve!
michael mikhalchuk : super fun casual 1 v 1 game with cool characters and challenges, amazing physics but too intense for my moto z4, slows down to a crawl when lots of things happening.
amy dyer : my kid loved this game... until it stopped working. we uninstalled it, but he recently wanted to play again. we downloaded it and it will not even open. every time he clicks on it, it pops up that it has to close.
exoticclegend : i like the overall feel of the game, but i find it hard to believe the 64 man online tournament isn't filled with bots, i just can't see how with only 5 million downloads that it finds 64 people so fast, is there a way to search for a 1 v 1
casey pape : this is a great time filler game. leveling up and unlocking new characters keeps the game fresh enough to continue coming back.
care l bear : i am so addicted to the game, i had it on my laptop but now on phone. i really didn't care my progress wasn't stored, only way i'd do a 5 star is bc i bought a different gun style this time & again nvr got it. yes i want it but it just prevents me to buy more & i soo would
talha j : too addictive, has a little bit of ads but that's okay for me. the music, however is awesome, gives you the western kind of vibes but with a gummy bear kind of twist. really love it!
jon tracey : so addicting. love the simplicity. the graphics are super clean and the controls are very precise. love this game
nathan winstanley : i give this a 4 stars because i got a new phone recently and this was the first game i installed and my progress wasn't saved even though i was logged into google play and was very disappointed but apart from that it's a great game but i don't fancy starting all over again
kristi marie brackman : amazing game 11/10 so i was snooping around on my phone and seen this game i immediately pressed on the app and downloaded it im about to play it some more can't wait for more updates edit:i have a note 10 and when i start that game its kinda laggy and slow i'm not sure if thats my wifi or what but it only does it on the first match so i'm giving 4 stars but when that is fixed ill give 5 stars
david hardesty : not a money grabbing game i love that. only had it for a couple weeks now and can't seem to find a reason to delete it. grafics are great. it's definitely a keeper.
josiah stocker : this game is a lot of fun. i love the ragdoll mechanics and their weird nonsense speech is hilarious. and there's a bunch of levels so lots of content.
al horgan : needs a seperate music and fx mute switch. i love this game, but i need to be able to hear the music/podcasts i want to hear and not sacrifice the sound effects.
vape kitty : it's broken like how does the ai have perfect 2 shot kill aim when i shoot then 5 times and they still live like it's not fun like i thought when first playing but oh no i lose twice and the ai just gets harder like that's just such bad game design
joseph : anyone else think it would be fun to view a replay of the duels??? can that be done??? maybe just give an option to save replay at the end of each battle, similar to the way you, refill your life before the next battle.
hackviz : very very very cuute game! it doesn't even has any violence. the controls are really good! thanks for the developer for making such a great physics game
[teh epik duck] : challenge, fun, and cool! the gummies with guns are a cool idea! it makes the game look funny and silly. and the sound effects make my gameplay very fun. i'd suggest adding loot boxes to earn gun skins, gummies, or possibly a gun! or maybe more challenges like a giant gummie boss, tiny gummies, or zombie gummies! anyways, love the game!
victoriouswheel : this actually one of very few mobile games that has any sort of improvement or skill curve. it's really nice to feel like i improved after awhile.
drew fischer : don't be fooled, it's not really online multiplayer; they don't do a very good job of hiding that. despite this, though, it's still a charming little ragdoll game with fun gameplay and creative artwork
matthew swaim : great game, but the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is because when it says that you go against "real" players worldwide, you aren't. they are bots. it's a great game overall, but if they could just implement a multi-player system, i would rate it higher.
ignited fishy : honestly, this game is perfect! haven't had a full moment. the progression is fair, and there are no components that force pay to win gameplay.
iownagorillalamp : this game is one of the best games i've played by far. the controls are great and the softbody physics are glorious. also this game has an actually good mobile ad instead of the horrendus ads that voodoo has been putting out
final flashman : so the game has the worst hit boxes, and you have to either watch ads or pay to use certain weapons, but it's fun when you first start.
disaster 122 : i played for 2 days and then an update comes along and i go to play it and now it freezes on my galaxy s10 after the title screen just sits on a blank biege page im outraged that i wasted my time getting good at this game just to not be able to play
wade nuthak : congrats, awesomeness in a game people,first there is very few ads,and the gameplay and physics are way cool and the sounds remind me of flubber the movie, keep it up
j murph : terriblely unbalanced, to make you pay. game baits you into thinking it's balanced for the first 5 minutes. than you have to pay to get health back every round in each tournament, making them impossible to win. the ai is extremely unbalanced and unfair. you dont pay against any actual players, its fake mutiplayer.
mohosina afrin chowdhury mishu : the game is good but it needs some improve ments.they should ad a joystick which can be used to control the character.if they get this the game will become 10 times better.
zaza onezashvili : this game is great in many ways while simple i truely suggest this game if you want too pass time while it has a cute art style and child like voicelines makes it far more family friendly while it is a wild west gun game they made it family friendly but still fun plenty of gameplay as well truely one of my favorite mobile games one feng i suggest is too give more coins too whoever gets further into the tournaments and too make more of a skill gap this is my report too the dev team hope it helps
anthony mora : this is honestly a good game in my opinion i haven't had this much fun at all. i would really love if this game had more skins or something like that and being able to unlock gun skins without paying but it's cool either way
andrew caris : super funny game, love the physics. the game has intuitive controls and feels very fluid. the action is non stop gun blasting fun.
evil patrick : this game is so damn good...i like the style and the theme..it is not boring at all but i would like you to add friends and duels between friends. it would be awesome! i highly recommend this game to everyone, enjoy!
jose de la rosa : this game is great the only way to make the game better in my opinion is to make it so you can unlock gun skins without waisting money i know you have to make money some how but as a 10 year old my mom won't spend money on phone games for me so can you make it so that you can unlock gun skins for free but pass that asside this game is great overall
deadpool1526 : it's so fun i can't stop playing it's just 2 things thing1. fight people thing2. fight!! it would be cooler if you have a bot on your team and on the others team otherwise it's really fun thank you!
mitchell hall : it just seems to be a marketing scheme. they make it look like it is multiplayer and have you play fake bots that look like they bought extra things. if this game was actually multiplayer it would be amazing.
isaiah_the_rtard : ok so the reason why i give this game 4 stars is because its a really good game its easy to get gummys and the guns look really cool but my problem is the levels...my most recent game my opponet was behind some crates while i was in plain site which in a way that was kinda unfair. but this game is great and if you see this game devs pls add local multiplayer pls
nicolas mrad : lots of bugs in the game. game keeps chosing revolver instead of shotgun. everything should be paid for! multi-player game is not even multi-player, not even online! game has a nice idea but very poorly developed.
space abyss : i love this game, the gameplay it's very simple, graphics in this game doesn't matter, but they are also beautiful. i love the soundtrack, it's funny and beautiful at the same time. one of the most funniest games i have played this year, thank you. :)
general person : good game but, you have to pay money to actually use the other guns, i unlocked the shotgun, and i was forced to only use the revolver, because you have to pay to use other guns, why is this a thing? i would have given it 5 stars if this stupid decision of pay to use guns wasn't a thing. until then, enjoy 2 stars.
brock goblin lord : an incredible game that has a tycoon style, a shoot out style, and a collecting style, it was just like the add and had lots of things to do just making it that i wanted to keep going
colton craig : extremely p2w with very little skill required. it is insane how p2w it is. you can buy health in the main mode to get an edge and you can buy characters that take less damage. completely p2w.
maxoryx : enjoyed the game a lot, it is very well designed, works well, is very fun to play, addicted to it right away, recommending it to everyone, developers! keep working on this game it is awesome
jayden reyes : i recommend you to get this game! it's really fun i'm so glad this isn't i like the other games where there's to many ads. again i recommend you to install this game! by the way it's just about playing with gummies :) and that's why this game deserves to get 5 stars
barnsey boy : there is not much to say a bout this game.it is just awsome,it is fun and not easy or difficult,this is a very nice online game as u never lag or there are no bugs.most importantly it doesn't have alot of ads.it is also a very nice game to get use to and keeps u entertained for a while.so recommended this game to everyone.thank you for making this awsome game
epic bright : deleted my old review on accident, this is p2w because you can just buy coins and continously heal, ads are not that much of a problem for me, also different maps will just screw you over because of random things in the way, let us choose our maps, unless you make us pay for that.
chris oquin : this is a great way to kill some time... intuitive controls, and a simple, fun premise.
aaron the 3d man : best game ever! the jelly physics are amazing, i enjoy the fact that this is not a pay2win sort of game. this game will test your skill in timing and aim, as well as your understanding of physics! love it!
brian pickavance : not real multiplayer. fun game for five minutes, but the real core of the game - dueling against opponents - is faked. actually ai enemies. disappointing.
matthew woolley : great game, not complicated at all and the controls are easy to use. great time killer while being a killer!!!
justjase82 : although the game is enjoyable and addictive, today i was faced with the sad fact that the vetting of names is sub standard. the "n" word was able to be taken as a player name, simply by spacing between each letter. considering there may be children playing this game, but more importantly that it is just a disgusting word, i would have expected more of an effort in preventing this type of behaviour. disappointed and appalled.
ito cool : unique, simple, and addicting the in-game-purchase are fun to buy, but in the same time not a pay-to-win game, prices are reasonable too there's a bug after level 10 where the first random gun is always flintlock
i feel like pablo : i've been beyond bored with mobile games recently and this game was a shining beacon of originality and fun for me. i don't usually do reviews but i just unlocked jules jackson as a gummy character and heard his victory taunt. i love this game so much lol.
erich knox : it's ok. the left handed shooting sets you up for failure and i am stuck at my current level and have been literally for months. it should not be that hard to advance, especially as i maxed out my gunfight stars.
llama hero : it's a fun game but th we te need to be cross hars cause you dont know your shooting and the trick shot when you press the reset button it restarts completely just do the levels that need replayed
jordan sangraw : boring. the movement and game play isn't fluid. solely single-player even when there's a multiplayer option.. it's just another players character controlled by ai.
ethan cline : this game is perfect! the only complaint i have is that there is no way to get the alternate gun skins without paying real money. if that changed, i would have no problems at all!
joe weisel : i love this game it's a good grind to soak up time. it's engaging and adorable. however i have 42 of 44 characters and it's saying i have them all and won't let me buy the last 2. help?
aram badr : love it ! especially the wiggly clumsy soft body feel of the characters i wish the material had more jelly ( refraction ) feel to it , i also wish it had the option to play against other player not only bots .. keep up the good wigglly wiggle work !
anoosh vicky : the game is awesome and iam addicted to this game, but it has some minor bugs which is quite irritating, only it works when i restart the game.
heartc0re _ : it's super fun!! never expected this kind of gameplay. graphics are good too. just having some frame rate issues on my oneplus5
ragdol gamzoid : you know i play this game alot. and mostly i use this red gum dude in the game profile. but i just wonder how i get to pause in an online gameplay. i mean they don't give me "your network is disturbing" alert. yeah some body explain that for me. what's different from the ai system
legend of zelda : it is a very unique game and surprisingly it doesn't get repetitive.you pass levels quickly,get new guns and skins and have fun.
necromanceryt : is a wonderful game full of fun physics,intense gameplay,and adorable characters, i do wish to see more games like this,pop up in the future!
audrius timleris : my expectations were low, but this game blew them right out of the water. it went above and beyond. very funy interesting, yet a little bit wobbly mechanics, and overall interesting game
sean townsend : solid gameplay loops. just wish there was a way to unlock customization in game as opposed to outright paying for it.
michael isaksen : honestly more fun that i thought is was going to be, but be warned the skill shooting parts may be a rage game for some! haven't wanted to throw my phone this bad since flappy bird..
franco tarantino : love it, love it, great time burner. hate the shotgun. hate paying for skins. should be able to earn stuff easier. its a game people - come on !!!
mark carter : i have only been playing a few days, but i am really enjoying it. only thing that doesn't feel great is the levels where you can fall off a cliff. more luck involved there. still enjoy the game!!
linktofuture : it's pretty fun but you gotta fix those smaller levels i always start right on the edge and my opponent starts in the middle with a couch or a table behind them it's always an instant lose for me
cameron johnson : instantly hooked. this is a rare gem of a game. what may seem random and luck based is actually very skill based with a little bit of what i call "chaos management". no obvious p2w mechanics. keep it up devs!!
mark cook : it's a simple concept, but done with great style and humour. brilliant graphics fun little time waster. still loving it
carolus rex : i love this app. but there are is only one thing wrong with it. sometimes bullets go through the top of the green bottle, and don't count as a hit. this got really frustrating.
martin smith : fun game, not a lot of ads. if you want the cool effects and fun stuff you have to buy it no way to unlock it by playing the game
mx : this game is extremely amazing. low ads, perfect quality, the game play is so fun and hilarious, i play it nearly an hour a day, it is such a fun game to play. definitely my favorite.
namyo : this is the best mobile game ever! no ads, no pay to win, no lag all is fine! also the characters sounds are so cute! this is indeed a cute game! i love this game! i recommend it.
amiel ray villador : this game was fun but the problem here is that there is no option for the controls, the aim part is too high in sensitivity and there is no option to change it.
siraj wahid : i love this game, but i really dont seem to have understood the "level up" dynamics. i'm at level 3 and, i think, i now have to just wait 2 hours to get to level 4. is that right? ....its probably just me, but i dont really get it.
ham fam : its a simple concept but a classic. and it is still in development which i'm down to see how this turns out. plus there's mado in it i'll make sure i buy this great limited offer on the game!!!
harry milligan : the graphics and game play are pretty great, but after just a few rounds you are practically forced to spend money if you want to make any progress.
luciano cendejas : the game is very fun and there isn't as much ads as many other games do so that is a big plus but i feel the creators should really add in at least some type of mode so you can go against real players because it is just to easy against bots
gfxbfx : extremely fun, great variety of weapons to choose from, different game modes that keep the game entertaining, 10/10.
roboto encore : this is a very good game, it's got good graphics, good gameplay, and i really love the physics engine and detail towards this game. i highly recommend giving this game a *shot* haha
albert chronic : it's okay. nice to kill time for a few minutes. replay value diminishes very quickly. didn't pass the marie kondo test after a few weeks: this one does not spark joy. don't have anything bad to say, either, it's just okay.
z : the gameplay is smooth and satisfying but only real problem is that there are no actual players. it's player vs bot so every match is against fake players. even says so in the description
jassimrat sran : i really like the game, physics and the simplicity is the best part. only issue for me is that it takes so long to just progress to the next stage.
nitish mohite : super cool and super funny game i've ever started playing. the graphics, music, background funny noises everything is dope. a must download for all who are bored playing trending games.
necmi musazade : very nice game. please bring the multiplayer mode to the game. for example 2 - 4 friends can play in the area
silydragon55 : annoying controls, always fighting ai who instantly aim at the head. head shots don't always kill instantly. extremely pay to win.
illuminatiproductions claw : how can i have 15 frames per second on a snapdragon 855+ ? it's not even stable, some games i play on 120fps and othertimes the game decides that i should have 15fps. the framerate is unbearable, that is on an asus rog phone 2, the latest cpu is 865, this is unreal.
wandee yang : everything is awesome but the only thing that needs to be worked is the loading screen. there is a wait screen before every single round. also the retry function shouldnt have to make me wait 15 seconds to refresh the level
dole merchant : i love thus game but i have two problems 1 please add multiplayer 2 it freezes randomly if i'm in match scrolling through the menu or anything else it will freeze constantly please fix this
veronica arballo : it's actual fun, i haven't played a game like this in a while, and it has so many interesting things, and there's things to buy, but it doesn't impact the game if you don't buy it, great job to the developers! you earned a new player:)
dux beee : its an amanzing game! i just wish we didnt have to pay in game currancey so much like medkits and confetti but other then that its a real time killer! me and my friends play it all the time im talking 24/7 gum slingers gameplay
tripixt : this game was ok, but the performance was not at all great. if you work you but off to get a new gun, it hits you in the face with a "sorry, you need to buy our premium for the gun." not worth the time.
_xxuselessxx_ : is good yes, but the problem is the "going pro" thing, it bothers me a lot, specifically when i can't even use an new gun, after playing it i deleted because of that reason edit: now this game is completely fun! thank you
abhi dev : the controls is not so good. please try to improve this. i think different way to shoot and jump will be more fun.
epicgamermonkey : one of the best games i have ever played. it would be great to see some sort of friends list so you can duel each other but this game has just came out so for what it is it is brilliant.
tigran martikian : im giving it five stars because i like the idea and the concept but there are some stuff you can add and take out. im not going to say them because they are only minor stuff that i experienced myself but still the game is good
cotzi idk : very good and adorable game :), i would like a third person shooter with this style of characters, and it could have a map maker just a suggestion
manish bajpai : a nice game ,though one thing that i don't understand why it's so hard to select a weapon.in the game. i don't know if it's a bug, but it's real pain while playing. fix it or teach it. make it simple.
undead gamer ph : this game is really awesome and plus it's perfect but there are some level or match that hard for example the falling duel it's so hard one shot and your dead
apple : this game absolutely sucks, the aiming sucks. the gun shoot time sucks. the fish character is unfair. some maps make the enemy higher and you die easier. it has the worst leveling system. dont download this game sucks.
kmyab : there are some bugs but it's okay as it is a new game (btw bugs are that sometimes the bullets pass through) it's a very funny game and seriously i love it.
vipul motiwala : i loved the game. it's simplistic nature makes it more enjoyable. i purchased the game withing 2 hrs of playing it. couldn't get my head off of it.
william fleenor : fun free game! the pvp is the best feature. the only things you can purchase are cosmetic, so it's not at all pay to win.
karlosthekangaroo : i would probably give this game 4 stars but they lie about the game being online pvp. either admit that it's a single player game or make it multiplayer until then people are probably gonna realize and leave the game. edit: just found out that to use the guns you unlocked you have to pay or watch a ad to use the gun for 7 minutes that's the most stupid thing i've ever seen
dj bakka : i enjoyed most of the game a lot since it was very unique but now i have gotten quite far and i am 4 stars away from level countdown and every time i win a tournament the stars don't go up so i can't play anymore please fix this as i love the game and want to carry on playing i have now re downloaded so it is fixed but it could break again but thanks for the response
tom martin : not the best to be honest. look nothing kills my interest in games more then systems implemented only to coax payment. if the enemies get full health every round then why don't i? oh right you need to make coins more scarce so that people will buy your currency.
cadaver_ gaming : would give five stars if i knew what the damage chart meant. other than that. amazing game edit: thank ylu! if i was you i'd add a little question mark that brings up a tooltip telling you that. great game though. keep it up
ricardo mcintosh ottley : okay it's working now most of the functions are pretty good but we still have the problem of spawning on the edge of cliffs and falling off before the match even start
jack pepper : it's very fun and looks great. i'm finding it slows down a little after a while but that could just be my s7 getting old.
jon-laurence decespedes : played great for 5 days then became buggy and unplayable. do not spend money on this as when i reinstalled, i lost all of my progress and purchases despite "saving"
young cinta : great game. minimal ads and a fun play style. a target range to fiddle around with guns would be fun though.
marshall : great idea, everything cool, except, either they can't wtite code or they have no idea of fair play. the way it plays, i suspect the latter. how can i get shot when the opponent doesn't even have its gun pointed at me? takes some classes , learn to code. if you know how, take some pride in your work. the gun is supposed to be pointed at, and fired before it counts as a hit. at least thats how we did it back in tucson.
that_1 stupid-kid : it's a lot of fun, and i find myself playing it allot. its a fun time killer... you might find your self playing when you're supposed to be doing school or sleeping
bryan rodriguez : this is a great game! i love all the characters the levels and everything about it! i really suggest 2v2 that would be awsome!! love the game.
garv agarwal : pretty great game! love the graphics and art style, very simple to play/learn but doesn't really get boring.
david rivera : great game, great play. fun. however, in the middle of the game this ad came on that was pretty much pornographic. i've got a little girl. i don't need her seeing that. i don't need to be seeing it, either, honestly.
mindles _ : i hate the game, the bots are annoying and it forces me to go buy gun skins and go pro, i mean going go pros price isnt even close to being worth it it just removes those annoying ads, and every single time the game forces me to go pro its just annoying and i hope the game is more balanced
seb cen : after unlocking the first gun i found out that to put bullets in it you need to buy the pro version or watch a video, even after watching the video it didn't give me bullets. 1 star and uninstalled immediately.
daniel williamson : i love this game! right now i'm on level two with the shot gun. but the medkits are used automatically as far as i know and i want to use it at my own pace. amazing game!!! i love it, and would recommend to a friend!
watergun official : the game is overall awesome you can play both online and offline but it would be great if i was able to choose some guns without purchase..
vikas mehta : i have paid for premium and a skin in the game and niw i regret it.... last few updates have taken too much time... there's been nothing new with the game play and just one new level this update....yeah....one..which you can finish in 20 minutes.. and the next is in february...what? you got nothing nrw and you expect to pay for skins for what? 20 mins of game play every update which is the same. come on do better. justify the payment or shut off any payment and go home be done with the game.
lohit pradhan : cool. paywall is minimal but the track system makes it stale to grind out initial levels. online is pv player bots but its alright since you can play it offline still
daniel burs : this is a fun game, you can get wrapped up in the tourneys once you get the hang of the controls. sometimes i wish there was a jump button tho
gaurav sood : simple, addictive and something different for all to try. this game is the right balance of everything. one o of the best games here and i have tried out tons of them all these years!
glen bennett : this is the best mobile game i've ever played. i've been playing this for 3 hours now. immediately addictive. thinking about upgrading to pro. i will never delete this game. developers, you did a great job!
reagan : adorable and simple but still nuanced gameplay if you take the time to mess with it. perfect for the casual timewaster or a collecting player!
eklavya : funniest game i have ever seen in play store.the characters and areas are too funny,i suggest everyone to play this game.the areas contains some difficulties making this game good.the tournament are very difficult.i request the game makers to make a small battle royal mode with 10 players at once and a small city.
leonard billones : this game is awesome! only one thing will make it better,if you can control where your *gumslinger* would go but if you don't understand i actually mean you could make the units walk like you can control them so you gonna add this as an update or not but please read my suggestion the dev of this game please and if you update this game i want to see the *gumslingers* walk or run into action please dev please
abhilash s : great game!!! just want to add one stuff for improving your game. why dont you make the character dodge and jump. it will be great addon just left up swipe for jump and down for dodge.
duck duck : overall i thought this game was amazing but when i opened up my file explorer i saw a bunch of new files which were from this game and i clicked on a couple and they were ads downloaded onto my phone.
noah newberry : super easy fun game with simple and easy to learn controls with fun colourful graphics and good game mechanics wish that there was multiplayer though
somnath clare : huge thanks to the developer for making this amazing game and huge thanks to youtube ( down to top ) for mentioning this amazing game . graphics are very good , cute , game play mechanics are good , controls are good and easy ...keep it up developers. best wishes
daudul islam : decent cute game but not so free enough. tried to buy but after purchase nothing happened, maybe my cars declined. without decent gun, after level 2,it's a serious game from then. can devs give me a free pro access during this pandemic?
kurt : nice and wacky shooter game most of the game is easy but when you want to do a sharp shot mode thats when the game gets tough but most of us just a nice calm fun shooter and tbh i loaded it because it had a cool name so i gave it a shot. lol i guess i like the. c ya
jessy martin : the game was great and i was loving it. but then i switched phones and lost all my progress and all the characters i had unlocked.
frenzii! : this is amazing it has amazing graphics and the sound are amazing best time killer not to easy and not too hard it's super fun and it wastes soooo much time its the ideal game tbh also there's little to no adds i love this game new fav mobile
andrew gonzalez : some of the scenarios you're put in are sometimes unfair. you'll be put on the edge and the first shot made on you will cause you to fall off and lose, while the other player doesn't get put on the edge.
be water my friend : everythings great the ads are finally gone theres been no bugs im glad it works alot offline an online great work edit:some reason when i was trying to do a update i lost all my progress i cant get it back now this is still five stars i just need my progress back
jaden lyons : very fun andifferent likeable and relaxing. i also enjoy the new features. want to add to my facebook for saving. any help on how to save??
josip grgetic : i love everything about this game except the fact that it isn't actually multiplayer, i mean how hard is it to make it multiplayer. it wouldn't even be a problem if you didn't act like it was multiplayer.
fransiskus : nice mini game that has similar gelatinous char like gang beast, human fall flat which i adore. ads is not intrusive for free ver, appreciated. it has mtx even for pro version. it's entirely optional nonetheless.
kim slater : addicting! i would like it to be quicker loading but i am having fun with my little gummy fighters. it needs some tweaking but is entertaining.
leilani palmer : it's fun looking but not easy to navigate and the screens seem slow to respond. the aim seems off.
b r u h m o m e n t : i gave it 5 stars because it is a very good and funny game. one thing i want the developers to do though is to add line where your gun is pointing so you can shoot more accurately. great game though.
pizza lord : ok i really like this game'but would love to see more additions like more characters! and weapons'anyway cool game keeps you entertained for quite awhile'also one more thing is plz add more maps!
lightninggg : this is a funny game that uses western style with gummys. why i rated it four stars is sometimes its glitches a lot. so over all funny game just needs some bug fixes.
wendy douglas : love! so fun and great time killer. the characters are silly and love the graphics and motion of the slingers. 10/10 would recommend.
uncreativename : awesome game with fun visuals and simple, yet challenging controls. would love a play with your friends option
jacob wong : i just want to play the game. i can't find the button to play the game, in the menu. it should be big, and impossible to miss. absolute disgrace. game seems overly monetized too.
blox : it's a really good aim, and it helped me practice russian roulette with bb guns. i say that it is great for having fun and gambling you cash ingame. best game i've had since march, and i suggest you to install it and have fun too!
francesco acqua : nice game, but progress (or purchase) isn't linked to the google account so if you uninstall it, or install it on another device then you have to buy the pro version again.
acel loberiano : characters are adorable, game mechanics are simple and yet really fun and reminds me of some old, nostolgic game i used to play! keep up the good work devs!
dripstone : very stupid to play because the aim is bad and i get annoyed that the more farther i get in the torment the less damage you and the enemy does 5x damage i hit them in the head tho and i would get hit in the body and half of my health was gone
amanda lehman : absolutely love this game! hilarious mets shooter game. multiple "stages" or um... quests (idk how to classify it exactly) to have fun with! there's the classic tournaments, or if you're feelin' that you got the skills to pay the bills , try you're hand(gunlol) at skillshot. and there's even more! not to mention that there's a ton of shooters,guns and lots of skins! lmao i love how they jiggle and shake what their dev's gave em'! totally five outta five stars!!!
star boy : its a game with wonderful physics and supwr fun but...its not 5 star cuz i was all the way to the sniper gun...and one day the app closed and when i reopened it, my data was gone, and now im at the beggining again....idk if devs can see tbis but besides that glitch, great game
drakoblaze : such a simple and fun game, and surprisingly unique from the mobile market's usual contenders. it looks really good as well.
chuck steel : the only thing that would make this game better would be the ability to share an animation of a fight. there are some truly epic shots now and then.
namelles : this app is really awesome super fun and challenging loads of content and i actually wanted to pay money to support the game when 50,000 ads weren't crammed down my throat pro version super worth it 1000% reccomend. p.s please add a gummy thicc character into the game that would be awesome
brody maclean : the game is awesome! i love the design and the concept. though i wish there was a way to get free gun skins without buying them.
charles boley : so far i've played a couple duels and it seems like a really good game fun to play very challenging at times you got to be quick with the draw anyways very cool game give two thumbs up props to them creators of *****"gumslingers baby"*****
alexander macintosh : i give suggestions or ideas to make this game even better yet need to be able to do battles with friends as with 1v1s an you keep progressing with the best players in a league kind of like thsoe when u beat one the winner of the other fight needs to fight you now an so on i think it be an aws addition
someone that doesn't matter : yes this game is really enjoyable, and i don't wanna explain to much because the other reviews explained everything. also this may not be necessary but can you add custom characters. by that i mean you get a empty gunslinger and you add accessories and stuff like that, on the empty gunslinger.
-_- : gumslingers is great i love the competitiveness, the goofy and creative characters and guns, and i just appreciate how unique gumslingers is. as long as the gumslingers team keeps this in devopment, i think this will be a very innovative game. much love keep up the good work.
jelly goat : i think that this game is geat and earned all five stars. it would be much better however if there was a multiplayer option that allowed you to play with your friends.
arjan : i like to support developers, but i felt robbed... spend over 5 euros for nothing. i do regret spending the 5.49 to the developer for the pro version. it doesn't give you any extras. you still have to watch videos for coins. you still have to purchase skins for guns. this is one reasons i would sideload apps....
henry velez : very fun game. i was wondering if you guys can add much good stuff in the future. also nice to the update featuring quest, bosses, and more.
nate betts : interesting graphics and controls. thought it was a arcade game, not a boring online only game.
jethro javier : a really cool game to pass time. not a lot of ads unlike ketchapp games. good job guys! thank you for not making the game run ads every single level!
kevin ward : there is a bug in the game where ill try to load in and it stalls and freezes and its truly annoying fix it and i will change my review.
swordsman baby : oh yeah i just wanted to says that the game is very very i mean very fun but i a countered a probleme with it wen i shot at the person's head it was like "nope" the second time "nope" the third time "nope" and the other guy or girl killed me. :p
tanay : this game is really fun, the ads are not annoying and it feels like a perfect combination of for skill+luck game. can't wait for more content!
arjun juju : good casual game. hooks anyone with their witty characters and nice background music. whole experience is great!
james talbert : great, great game. it's free, so why not get it? it's fun, graphics and gameplay are great, and it's got a fun theme. has some ads but that's the price of a free game. you have no reason not to try this great game.
tammi t martin : not horrible but bad. couldn't get it to play with it loaded onto the sd card. had to load it to internal storage to get it to open.
christmas compound : pretty good game. i think it needs an update where you get coins, and buy skins and weapons from the coins. overall it's a nice game.
deacon bratcher : cool idea, terrible execution. all you have to do is get shot in the leg and its game over. if this was a real offline game, sure, it could be fun. but the pvp is absolute cancer.
macecraft m.c : i'm really good at the game. but sometimes my shots just won't hit the player, and other times their head shots will instant kill me but my headshots will barely destroy half their health.
joshua kilts : way too laggy on the note20 ultra. tried multiple configurations, but alas, it is only this game that's laggy, no other games. fun concept, but unplayable.
william wallace : horrible experience, because you have no idea what buttons to push in order to continue the game. it's an interesting game but my god what idiot designed this game for simplicity. noone...! there's enough dumb a** people out there designing games and apparently you've employed one of them. great game but hey how the f do i play it without pushing every button there possibly is and just retreating because it's not worth your effort
gage monroe : nice gameplay, good controls. my only complaint is that most of the opponents are bots, and not real people.
isaac clagg : gumslinger is the best gunslinging game there is! i wish the shotgun ammo and the skins cost in game money not real money,but other than that it is the best game! i reccomend it to everyone!
jayda mercer : a whole lot of fun, good balance between ads and gameplay. very cute graphics and nice controls.
thomas feeley : very simple controls multiple things to do as you get more stars keeps thing interesting. keep up the good work.
ananda krishnan : very funny game. the game is very best of the year and the graphics is perfect ok.the control are very difficult in other games. i am rated 5 star the game. i like very much this game
czarkaztik1 : the flying pizzas have serious issues with how hits are counted and it can be pretty laggy at times but overall a solid game.
antone adam : could be a decent game if they fixed the match making. you get some guys who shoot you once and you die instantly, but it takes 5-6 hits to bring them down.
eidan batista : i pulled the finger at your game. my head hurts from playing it. the game doesn't even give you a win. if that were the case, i'd at least feel a little happy, but no, every time i play i lost. i played this game on another device and the same thing happened. frick your game.
rom rom gramsey : great game but could you add a multiplayer mode like if i am on a device and a friend is on another could we connect and we fight each other but other than that the game is awesome
rusty : why do they keep trying to tell you that you are playing against real poeple. if you tont touch the screen the enemy doesn't shoot. also the "ai" have the same names as the "real players".
alex g : this game is prolly the funniest/best casual game out right now. i've never left a review for a game... like never. i'm lazy like that lol. but when this game asked me if i wanted to rate it, i felt it would go against my morals not to (beings that its so good).
cole hammond : the graphics and physics are stunning, however the game is just not that fun to play for very long.
sab fern : great gameplay, cool design, fun physics, unique mechanics. this game's got it all! for a mobile game, its a masterwork.
rosiel vilbar : this game is frickin..awesome....i love the gameplay...and tha graphic...mwuahh magnifico...i love the guns too specaily the shotgun...and the characters there so funny...can u put the coop mode so ican play 1v1 with my brother that will awesome..if you do that i give it 5 star...
fors4ken 696 : hi :) i love these game but at times it feels repetitive. please add more game modes or maby cool online events. other than that is great. i have some opinions tho. like maby add an online 2v2 mode :/ thank you !!!
chuck straw : its fun, its really challenging. and more than a bit cute. and just plain a awesome game it deserves 6 stars if that were possible... cant say enough good about it, its great!!
jesus ibarra : pretty awsome but please give a better reward for super skill shot atleast a badge on you'r account or on the gunslinger him self like the crown badge you get on the gumslinger when you win a random guns,and if theres a way if you do implement it to not reset my win i dont want to do another super skill shot again ;-;
noodles : this is probable the best game i've every played on mobile really fun ,nice and simple graphics,no pay to win aspect cheap skins ,loads of levels but what would even make this better is if you could fight with your friends in a 1v1
freddy ventura : first app where i purchase add free extras and coins, i look forward for future updates to improve gameplay and keeping the game fresh. really fun.
rico swavless : from the jump its obvious its a pay to win game. my bullets bounced off a certain gummy guy and did little dammage came across different person with same gummy and again near to no damage.
juan mendoza : i really like the game but i really hate that you have to watch a ad just for ammo and have to get to a new level to get a new gun please make something so we can buy the guns
starvi_os : the gameplay is really fun, and the music is the best part :) the controls are probably the best in this cowboy duel kind of games
antonio lopez : i am addicted to this game! just got it today, and i am already on level two. i just unlocked the shotgun. the mechanics are original and easy to learn! easily a 5-star! keep it up!
andrew1212 : its a good game but too greedy. you have only have aone revolver if u play it free. when u unlock a new weapon in lvl 2 then u cant use it directly. you have to watch an ad to play with it for 7 mins. i will give 5 star if u just unlock the standard weapons.
corrupt faith : they consistently put you in a position to lose like starting next to a cliff so if you get hit once you fall off. horrible.
jack elvey : great fun, skill is well rewarded, though i feel the hitbox isn't completely accurate in all cases (i swear i hit that can three times midair!)
notacocoabean : fun until you unlock the next gun and it tries force you to either pay or watch ads to "load it" no point in trying to unlock anything as you can't use it without using real money
amol mittal : updating: lowering rating because i'm pretty sure the online play is completely fake. you are playing against a bot. great game. would love a way to play with specific people/friends on facebook.
jonathan bulanhagui : i like the concept of this game even availed pro the next hour of playing however the fps drop is too often esp during skillshot missions. will rate 5 stars upon fix of that issue
pablo arriagada : actually a super fun and nice game, it's not a challenge or something to stress about while playing so it's great to just hop on and duel with some gummies.
guru tech : really awesome, why don't you guys make something like valorant for mobile the game engine looks pretty nice, and love to see such perfect touch texture on valorant kind of game in mobile.
naman arora : what a beautiful game! i paid for the pro version within an hour of playing. great concept, executed into perfection.
shop_lifter58 -_- : 5/5 stunning graphics and a great performance really good physics and perfect controls and i don't have anything else to say but to just say overall really fun and quick game to play
ali razavi : i really like the concept of the game the ragdolls are funny the physics is nice but i think this game needs a multiplayer system which people can play pvp if that happens the game would be really enjoyable and won't get tedious ill give 5 stars if that'll happen
ansam alnuaimi : this game is very silly amd fun i love it but the problem is u should add more gamemodes like when u get to lvl 4 there should be a level called taking out guards sneakily but this game is very fun very silly and very ragdolling i love it 5/5 stars its addicting and amazing i hope u add more new levels with new gamemodes.
red sector : great game, really fun, and a great execution on a great idea. only reason i gave 4 stars is because i wish it was properly multiplayer, but i'm not sure if that will ever happen
random things : last year ----->(worst jelly-like game ever the aceresy of the guns are horrible!!!, horrible!!!!!) sorry about that i was just pissed but you do need to work on the trick shot stuff its neer impossible for me to "pipe it"
ana71 amg : this is a great game! it has amazing graphics and it has easy controls that u can pick up on right away!
ali zalif : guys love the game!!! so much like it's very funny being a yummy and shooting people and stuff the graphics are great even the controller yeah i like this game so keep up the good work
jordan howley : had a fun time so far- but i switched phones, and now my progress is gone even though it said it was saved with google play games. is there any way to get this back? i'd purchased a starter pack.
michael richard : love the game, and only have one problem. skillshot is kinda harsh when you mess up once and restart it all. can you please find a way to fix this?
lupita jasso : awesome game, i really enjoyed it, the problem about not receiving the pro version after buying it was resolved in less than 24 hours. thanks!
randall bird : one of the absolute dumbest games ever created. if i am a game designer on this game i'm embarrassed. the creatures suck!! the movement is awful. you lose to inferior levels. even worse as you get up higher levels the developers decided to slant it towards lower levels so badly you can't win.
zeron _hp : the game has only skins for real money.... other things would be the game controls but... ...my thouths are to change the game a little but too much so i won't say....
pritam dutta : awesome and highly addictive... just need a option to reverse the controls... aim on left and shoot on right side...
august w : i really enjoy this game, however i'm being generous with the 5 stars, sometimes the controls don't respond at all, not letting me aim. the game itself however is very fun and neat, it's goofy yet competitive
l.l. baxter : great game, enjoyable to use controls, a few buggs, but not something that negatively affects the game too much.
first name last name : a great game to pass the game, the style is charming, the gameplay is simple, hard to master, and addictive.
lilnasa07 gaming : such a great game! the controls are si good and easy. sometimes you lose on the game but its pretty much not that hard to win a game
greg newhouse : pretty good, except for the ads that i cannot close, and have to exit and reopen the game. if that wasn't part of the picture, it would be a 5 star.
shadowlight x : it's alright kinda wish i could actually buy anything in game in a reasonable amount of time grinding pretty much works as intended your just not gonna get anything cool untill weeks or months worth of playing unless your willing to buy it it's not all that expensive i'm just not gonna
eleutheron pnevmaan : very nice adds. i enjoyed it the 5 first minutes... then adds every 2 rounds. uninstall. its a pity games like this to get thrown to garbage. well. that's what you get.
sean gangemi : it's fun but please give us more items it's kind of pay to enjoy. we don't get much effects like the splatter which makes it boring and plain.
guts : really good game, but i dont think it is multiplayer, the enemy only draws the weapon when you do and when you pause the game it still continues, i dont get why you would lie about that
thebluegun : fun modes, a lot of variation, great weapon choices, tons of skins to choose from, all around fun.
 : so fun and rather addictive. minimal ads, and it doesn't feel like a "pay to win" game. would highly recommend it!
char tee riley : love the ragdoll system but i like using the shot gun so i just wish that you could buy it with coins instead of buying it with real money and getring the pro so if the dev can see this can you guys make it where you can buy it with coins please?
guile g. : fun, cute, charming and easy to play. haven't gotten that far but i wonder if there's a dueling system with friends you can invite to play?
wanderer : fun game, gotta beat multiple players with the same health, you can use medkits to heal up..... when you run out it cost 100 coins when you beat 6 players you win 150 coins.... during these matches you need to use at least 1 medkit. great deal right? if you win that is, otherwise you wont gain any coins and only lose. could be better if it wasn't so money hungry. also you aren't playing against players but against an ai
l.a. c : i don't understand why this app robbed me of over 1800 credits or (what ever they're called) after buying 1 new gum slinger which only costs 400. now all of my money is gone. it took everything for one stupid purchase. i liked this game until this
lee parker : i love this game and think its great for a quick pick up and play. definitely worth paying the small amount to remove ads as i have already got my monies worth from it.
bounce ball : the game is overall fun and good i played and i had a fun time but i wish that some of the guns didnt have to be paid with real money and more with the in game coins and sometimes the game lags when i play.
raluis fernandez : this game is a hidden gem.i deleted my last review from a few months ago and i also deleted the game a while back too.i reinstalled it and wow.all weapons are now free.amazing change.that alone would make a 5 star game but you guys added more modes,weapons and more characters.if you guys add keep up what your doing and add multiplayer/online this game would last a long time.i really hope to see more games from you guys. edit:you guys also respond to all comments and take criticism.major plus
jon phillip tschopp : sweet idea. love the competition! a lot of good fun. great simple smooth and vivid graphics! a must in your gaming collection! jt
srijan dokania : it's good but.. please make it multiplayer. i want my friends able to play this game against me and we can have a custom tournament within our group.. please tell when will you make this game multiplayer so that we can make a room and play there
ben bowles : it was pretty fun for a few minutes. then it forced ads and/or required money to progress.
akhil p dominic : the game is not for competitive game play. it gets stuck every time the shooting starts. and there is a ton of ads
katherine ellingson : everyone who put 5 star are pretty accurate, this game is really fun and ive been playing it for hours! every level you get new guns and i have shot gun. game is awesome and you will be satifyed.
ben f : excellent game with fun graphics. the best part is it rewards skill and co-ordination.
aurosheet mishra : game shows too many adds every 2min and after the add ends the game lags i have snapdragon 845 and a 6 gb ram on my device but still the game lags and runs on 10 fps even at low settings so fix the problem developers
ll8ma : don't get. basically with the starting stages when you get to the last couple with the ai they are made to not be able to shoot anything but your head.
yoiba doiba : i really like the game but therw is a problem with the map where objects block my shot making the ai shoot me without fighting back. pls fix
h15 h15 : the game is greedy because it forces you to buy pro or else your gonna have to whatch ads every 7 mins which is kinda frustrating and there online matches dont even seem real they all look like bots sometimes bullets dont hit stuff even tho it shows it hitting the thing
nick yocom : the physics are humorous and i really enjoy the game. however the noises the gummys make scare me i had a nightmare where they attacked my house and ate me because they were mad i ate gummy worms instead of them. but it's a fun game
orkegarddon : this game may be about battling live players and winning tournaments but you will have a smile on your face with how the game looks and feels the characters when they get hit is funny and the game overall is a cute and funny game and you will have a good time playing it
alex tetreault : it's a lot of fun very unique but it would be great if when you shot them whatever color liquid comes out or there were actually bullet holes
majiri tadakichi : played it for 3 minutes, instantly in love with it. looking forward to spending countless idle hours playing this fun unique little game.
anastasia bethell : it is technically like rdr but in gum version .rdr was my favorite game during my childhood ,i remember it like was yesterday, when i was 6 years old, i got rdr on my ps3,i was so excited!i would wake up 7.00 am in the morning just to play rdr on my ps3!oh the memories i had were amazing!
shane sa : love the game. it's just fun. would be 5 stars if there was a way for real pvp. even if you have to wait for each other a bit. but it's fun and physics are really good.
jonathan salinas : love this game, honestly i've never paid for a mobile game until now , totally love the no ads and how it's set up to get a lot of coins from playing.
court jester 25 : didn't love it. i didn't play this game for long, but it got boring really quickly. it's not a terrible game or anything, but it's not very interactive. the controls are pretty laggy, too.
tomika bell : this app is so fun i'm at level 2 and shotgun is pretty awesome this is also a pretty fun challenge at the same time you got to be fast to aim and shoot and that is basically the whole game
daniel s. : really fun, very creative, and eye appealing. i love the silly voices and dances after beating somebody.
aaron osborne : fun way to waste some time. simple to play and lots of interesting weapons available as you progress
michael winters : really fun game with minimal ads, and cheap but fun optional purchases. definitely kills time at work!
noah singleton : great game. i don't have any complaints about it should be alot more popular. also i like the fact that the characters look like gang beasts. so this is easy 5 star
jackson morgan : great game i love it when you get shot and flop all over the place. but i dont like how you get the crossbow at level 3 but it's not powerful at all.
 : it is an addictive and a really nice game but it starts to become kinda boring after 1 or 2 days.a pvp mode,new game mechanics like jumping whenever you want or quickshooting with revolver would be so cool.new game modes would be really nice too like 2v2 mode with your friend would be really nice
nebras salheb : the game has a great concept and art style but the micro transactions style and the difficulty ceiling is ruining the experience
sombit ganguly : great game it's intense and interesting in update add more character and character ability , pets , grenade using game currency , new look of store , library where we can see character story please reply thanks for the great games that you guys make
richard prouty : great game i dont usually write these reviews just cause i'm lazy but this game definitely deserves it great graphics very good response time on taps and last but not least ads only come in every so often and they arnt overloading you with ads great game guys thank you so much keep up the great work
kaan : actually, the game is very nice, but it seems very difficult for me. i couldn't solve the jumping mechanics too. if my character did not jump, i could beat the guy in front of me, but my character is zipping. briefly nice game
alex boustany : very good game. only thing that is missing is a detailed stats board. like what was the quickest round, what gun i use the most, accuracy and so on...
koki 58 : nice idea and that's it... no players online. i started playing against ai and before every game it displays: "you are offline. please go online" i went online - still playing against ai but now with adverts... got bored under an hour.
laurynas butkevicius : it's impossible to play because optimisation is very bad. i'm using pocophone f1, yet it is lagging on every shot or movement.
sam h : super fun! the game is a little laggy but still playable. the game is simple yet challenging.
jamie cull-host : really enjoy it, especially the fact that they actually fix bugs! also the ai programming is impressive.
jare encallado : nice gameplay and the graphics are superb. hope we can unlock the pro mode without spending cash.
adi narayan : totally worth it .. gameplay and graphics are good! plus the progression in game is based on your skill and luck .. no grinding !!!!
somebdy : what to say about this game man it is really nice not really much violence which i like btw also very cute graphics so really nice no great it is very good especially the tournaments they are fast and quick exactly i was looking for i cannot say much more because if i do i would go on for a long time really long but the game is much better than i than explain in my review so devs really good work and being a developer myself it is nice to know that developers are not all bad and create copies
paulo henrique de oliveira neto : great game, fully recommend it. very very few ads, not pay to win or whatever, excellent for killing time.
talokin : great game! ads nonexistent! no money grabbing! play, get good and you get in-game scratch. i will gladly pay money into a game if you don't ask me for it!!!! fantastic folks!
alyssa smith : great game, great people. asthetically pleasing, addictive and fun! i had an issue with my game and messaged them-- they responded and fixed the problem within the same day <3
carl houliston : remove the ads well worth the money 2 go pro. awesome gameplay, control's and graphic dynamics. addiction guaranteed.
michael fabian jr : i love this game and it normally runs with no complications but 4 some reason today when i click on the icon 4 it it acts like it wants to take me to the game and then just shoots me right back to my main home page
sahil sagar : gud game. only one complaint , it lags on my oneplus 7t. i dont think so this is a hardware issue. probably needs some optimisations. overall fun game.
lancegtr trump : great game has a lot of different skin it's active and you can play it anytime you want and has competitive action the graphics are cool and really high quality
roow51 : the game is great but can you add a chromebook mode? its hard moving the mouse back and forth and i dont have a touchscreen
cole plunkett : hands down the most entertaining mobile game i've ever played. a game that doesn't require your to spend real money to advance, finally! good for some laughs!
mr. rtv : perfect! it's a mix of fun and yum! it's like that game called gummys life. but more fun and better! it's great but could you add a replay mode? i will keep supporting this game!
jea-pierre samuels : damn...great game but the gameplay hampered by the money grabbing attempt of forcing adverts down your throat... i honestly don't mind watching adverts to get rewarded for waiting, but just putting in adverts so one can continue gaming is stupid af.
corey pine : i love this game! i love the character design, the physics are amazing(along with the graphics) i would love more games from you in the future! 9999/5555
cody gaither : this is a really fun game i got to say this game is overrated cuz you can actually kill people and there's no two player is there a two-player? but this is really fun even if you die it's still pretty fun so this is why i raided this five-star the creator is the best
tim berberich : great game, but it's a bummer i have to wait hours after i've collected all the stars when i've paid for a pro account. kind of feel like we should be able to skip the wait if we've paid?
alejandro soto : like the physics of the projectiles. cool graphics. not much ads for a free game.
tom stars : this game is addicting fun. smoth gameplay, great physics, no lag. it feels dynamic, plus you can jump around like we're in the 'matrix' haha.
vasily mclarin : purchase failed. i bought a starter kit, money was debited. and in the game, nothing was credited and a new skin on the weapon did not appear.
 : too many random missed shots when aiming dead center, then you have the bots with random godlike accuracy... fun half the time
ishmael farrelly : find the game hard personally. but still love it. honestly a great game and quite entertaining. definitely worth your time. and if you havent downloaded this game yet. go hurry and download it buddy.
val k : one more great time killer from this dev where you don't have to spend hours to learn how play it and spend hundreds of dollars. all the prices are reasonable and everyone must get paid for their work. ads are not intrusive.
kevin williams : game is very cheesy, but very fun. addictive to play. great for lunch breaks or to just kill 15 minutes or even hours.
velvet aeon : great shooter duel game. the graphics are sharp and quirky. unlocking new gumfighters and guns keeps it interesting.
m tv : this is one of the best shooting game in my opinion, but it lacks the invite a friend to a duel. it be more fun if dev can add it on next update.
ollie haycock : brilliant game, amazing physics and just so much fun to play. well done to the developers for bringing a genuinely exciting game to the play store.
ben rut : the grapichs was bad cus when i shot the pizza it did nothing so can you update it to have no bugs and when the player shot me in the head i die for real and the gameplay sucks cus everytime i play rules it gives me a relover and i hate the relover and everone keeps winning on me so i hate your game cus i keep losing so i'm not installing your game ever ever again
malcolm forsythe : this is the most fun i've had with a mobile game for a while. it isn't pay to win, it's pretty much purely skill. also, their bot system is a genius idea.
el_pablo lopez : amazing just amazing the game is so fun i could play this for hours i love if i ever got money i will go pro! i will really recommend it to anyone who likes to duel in the games and like a bit of fun too!
wai em : this game is really fun and funny. everything is fair and cool. but it's a bit complicated to know when or how to level up exactly.
angry vault guy : pretty fun but to make it even better your opponent when shot should have its limbs exploding or something like that their has to be more impact for the bullets
keagan velde : very well made, tough at times, but very good indeed. worth a look, lots of free content available
nialon : this is an amazing game this game offers pro but its still really fun without it and even if you want to get the pro version its very cheap you guys have made a great game pat on the back you are type of developers who keep the free gaming market alive : )
vinayak arora : fabulous! jello! delicious! i have no words man... this is fantastic! great gameplay, challenging and addictive... btw, there is a tiny request. can u add bluetooth/wifi multiplayer mode??
drip drip : i love dis game but u know wat is really u annoying? u cant even freakin equip specific gun its all random i hate it...i would give dis a 5 star if the developers would enable an equip function into it. thank you
fadorfox : there are some hilarious glitches in it, which do make the experience more hilarious. the gameplay itself is alright.
donny : it's a really fun game with beautiful graphics, great sound effects, lots of variety, and simple controls.
oltean catalin : please implement google play saves. so i can play on my tablet if my phone is out of reach. and i payed for skin on the phone. don't want to start over.
joe matthews : please please make a left handed setting! all that's needed is a setting to swap aim and shoot buttons.
dennis shaw : this game was loads of fun until you tried to make me watch an ad to use a gun that i already earned (my only other option being to buy the pro version). uninstalled.
brandon elm : this is a really fun time suck. i don't play phone games but the progression and physics system makes this a absolute gem.
therussiangoose : definitely a good game, not too many ads and it doesn't shove any subscription in your face. i'd recommend to my family but they already have it :d
greenalien 51 : this game funny and addictive. would love to see more playable characters as action and destructible environments.
hybrid : its fun but the annoying objects makes it more annoying it keeps blocking bullets and what makes it worse is that when you jump its even worse too i cant even shhot that player.
sava savov : nice, simple, funny game. nothing complex. pay is for look, not win and the ads seem almost no present.
tiffany eblin : i haven't even had this game for 24hrs and i've alresdy put a couple dollars into it. i never put money on phone games. this game deserves it though.! great game guys. 5 star from me.!! :)
shane rafferty : game recently started getting really slow an laggy. tried adjusting graphics an setting. nothing.
amulya singh : a very fun game, helps you chill in your free time. very satisfying too... the game would be even better if the developers add google play games achievements. overall a great game.
optic_l3anboss : amazing game its super fun and really addictive my only problem is how long you have to wait to advance to the next level. otherwise very good game
christi cereghino : this game is awsome!!!!!! i wish there could be a like another mode were like the tournament you fight other players but there are four instead of two
why so delirious bro : if i could give it less, i would because they automatically aim at the head and when they shoot over your head it still hits.
asad dhorajiwala : you cannot win the tournament unless you pay to fill you healthbar every round. this is stupid and clearly makes it a lot easier for people who buy coins to fill their healthbar.
mahesh pawar : yeah... great concept bro... i love it...!! background music is brilliant but still i faced some bugs..! please look into this asap...!!
saints for the win : this game is freaking amazing. great graphics, sound effects, physics. keep it up! and great price.
speedy sanik : needs more content it gets boring to just over and over to do the battle royale. also randomly crashes and closes the app when playing
jason sturgeon : hits don't register. i get the opponent down to no health immediately and then no other hits register and i die. a game that makes opponents invincible when they have no health get 1 star.
yisel alvarez : it is perfect it is funny chalenching pvp it also has a tournament and best of all the charecters can be changed like the guns and the are super flopy love it. best of all games chek their other game spagety arms
emerald essentials : good game overall, however the skillshot challenge is broken, and it is impossible to get the 2nd all star trophy.
tristan wright : i was going to shot the the he jump right into the enemy's shot the i died can you plz have a jump button or something plz i would enjoy playing it more but other than that i like everything about the game
david martinez : it's really fun and is getting my attention but it would be better if i could be able to play with a friend or even have like a mexican stand off styel too that would be amazing
enkitwo : i really like this game. fun, addictive, and challenging. perfect mix if replay ability.
peq 12 : yo itatake!!!! this is the most funniest game ive ever played!!! just can you pls add multiplayer? oh and add a little crosshair? thanks!!!! you have the most great game!!!!
ryan l : love the game, easy to learn and the tournaments are great. fast and intense. sadly all you play against are bots and it gets old quick
sip clan : it's a good game but i hate having to watch a add to use a new gun i dont have enough money to buy a special edition of the game so can u please make me not watch a add when i want to use a gun
hone walker : too frustrating on chromebook :/ when i go for a quick aim, the other guy is already spraying... update:downloaded it on phone and absolutely loved it.
gordan markulj : was fun but it's another pay to win game. also game is not optimised runs like ***** was working good but started droping fps like crazy... it's a big no no! my phone has high end specs. ,above required for this game.
jax murphy : perfect game if i could give it more stars i would the physics are awesome and it makes a great game to kill some time. its a funny game and it makes my day better when i play it
nash hudgens : love the game, but can you please change the game mechanics to where it doesnt randomize the gun you pick every time? i keep on tapping shotgun, but it sumtimes gives me the revolver.
ankit prwtkr : it's fun and enjoy easy interesting game. if you play it once you will get edicted to it and you will enjoy it ,this game is all about fun any one can play it easily and can have fun. nice game, i it........
cherolyn taylor : well i'd like to apologize for not being very nice now that i'm getting into the game it getting more good at it but the only think that bothers me is that we gotta pay real money to get gun skins maybe make the gun skins buyable but with only skin for one skin i mean buyable with game money
imartini : it's amazing and hilarious. the way the gunslinger fall and jiggle when the get shot just cracks me up. there are like no glitches or bugs and i honestly have high thoughts of this game. good job i ta take.
yousfi redouane : u should add settings for controls i want to shot in the right and aim in the left so i can get better view of enemies otherwise i'm in love with game
o.m. gaming : gumslinger is a western dual style game. very fun. i love a good challenge! plus it's good for passing time!
sanders clardy : looks amazing, gameplay is quick and procedurally generated, so statistically fair, no p2w. fun characters to unlock. unique game
sherloki tdk : pay to win. why does it need 200 cents for a health refill in next game. health should automatically be full for every new game. but no in this game u have the same health for entire tournament.
muhamed shan : guys just play this. this a really good game. the graphics and controls are decent. the gameplay is very funny. this is the best game i find in google play.
nicolas fonseca : a really great game with some hard levels and not to many ads but you need to watch and add just to use your new gun each time
carl brian van buskirk : very good game awesome game 5 stars for sure just 1 thing i don't really understand how to get the gun skins for my guns could you try to make it a little more similar and add a jump button but on the other hand fun game
darkgamer : this is one of the best games i played on my mobile like im always on my pc but some times when im waiting for something or im board im playing this game i like guns and gums so this is perfect for me hoping for updates soon hope alot of people donate if they can and this game has good graphics hope this game gets alooooooot of downloads more than 1b
ethan stainbrook : so much fun there is ads but they are all after the match you lose on or after the tournament. it is really fun, the physics are wacky and hilarious love it
stars of wars : excellent game, just one problem is there are players with very racist names like, " die filthy nagger" and a couple of others that i can't remember. thanks for a great game.
edgerd depas : fun game until you start winning stuff and you have to pay or watch an ad to use them! what a ridiculous concept! uninstalled!!
crazy nodes : gumslinger is so good i want it to be a gumslinger 2 but im just saying its so good its grafics are so good its guns on so good too hopefully the future updates are good good this game is so good i would give it 10 stars even a million stars i love this game so much sometimes i even make the gunslinger characters out of gum without me eating it every time i listen to the song and the game it warms my heart i love this game so much to the point i cannot stop playing !(:
kaiden high : love this game, only thing i would say is why don't you have infinity healing after your battle, and it's very hard to level up to get better guns besides those i would give it five stars
mack ling : kind of fun but after the first round, couldn't figure out how to play again. it's full of incomprehensible options. gave up.
magpie anime : only been playing for 2 days and i love it the graphics are great and the gameplay is repetitive but the gameplay is not boring so i would recommend this game to everyone
larry jenkins : i just love this game!!! don't need blood and glory just simple fun for all ages!!! keep up the good work dev's and hope to see more games like this one!!!!!
lane cornell : i've had a ton of fun playing this game. even the ai on single player gives you a good challenge from time to time. i'm definitely hooked.
likeablekiwi : i like it but its kinda funny how every opponent i come across that uses a shotgun just blast downwards or upwards without a care in the world which makes me want to join them with the pellet rain also for those who complains about the bots they should pay attention to the tag "offline" first before downloading
nasir qureshi : seemed ok in the beginning... but the new weapons and learning curve makes the novelty of this game incredible every level
vincenzo kristoff ii : the boss when you lose its very you want to go again wich is very smart to get the player to stay playing until you beat the boss the game is very fun to and the shotgun mode is very fun
melesa e. fary : so, so much fun! simple game play and the characters are funny and quirky too!! no ads, no money grabs so why aren't you playing yet !!! i am juicy fruit so look for me!
nuclear gamer : this by far my best mobile game (besides minecraft) addicting a little to addicting. hope more skins come out in the future. it would also be good if you can move around.
ooga booga : the day before i was able to start the game now i cant even start the game it just crashes everytime, but besides that i love the game, i reinstalled the game and it works perfectly fine now it's ok cause i didn't have much
roit carnage : this game is sick.....amazing graphics,cool gunz,and cool and funny characters and i love the challenges too..and i even share this game with my friends..and they love...pls put co-op so me and my friends can battle at each other...amazing game 10/10..keep up the good work guys...bamba out peace
gage stewart : fantastic game, but please add some way to play against other people, even if it's just friendly matches with an invite code or something!
alex venafro : sick idea for a game, wild west meets sour patch kids very colourful but if you're going that far ,make it available online as well. i enjoy it other than that.
dominic belleman : wow this game is amazing there is so many games out there that are just horrible this isn't one.i have seen the market get plagued with pay to win this one is fun 10/10 would recommend to anybody that appreciates quality games.
agolloh : great game but some sort of dismemberment feature would make it better! since they're gum after all so it's to be expected they'll break apart from bullets
preston mynes : it's so dumb you shuld not make your character jump out of a place because when i do that it just makes me fall and die and you shuld not have to watch a ad to use the shotgun or go pro
aditya pratama : the best game and the funniest game i ever played the physics is very incredible. i will recommend this game to all of my friend. oh yeah pls add 3 2 1 before the game started.
wanieaffendi : at the first level is easy but at the second level is hard can u make a jump and crouch button pls that will help full to dodge
jos : its a really fun game. but very disappointed that the only way to get different weapon skins is by paying real money...
emmanuel juarez : the game is good in my opinion, it's not so pay to win because there is only 2 things to buy gun skins and pro the game controls are good in my opinion.
waluo abu obaid : amazing game but it has to have more levels edit: the concept of the game is so great, great job guys, i would also recommend to you guys make a pvp facebook friends battle
zer0ax : this game is truly remarkable, the psychics are good and it's a great way to pass time one of the best mobile games i have ever played. 10/10 all around. good work!!!
steven meredith : excellent time killer and hardly no ads which is a must in these days of greedy game creators all round fun and also a challenge on the trickshots............ all in all i'll be keeping this
keykay3200 : the game is kinda cool but why do i keep losing every round and also i need to explain why is the shotgun weak and why is the crossbow really weak this game 1 star i hate it.please do not install the game it is trash. the creator must add a weapon upgrader
tristan oostendorp : it's a great game, i'm really addicted to it. there's not alot of ads... but there's still ads. that's my only dislike. everything else is great
nathaniel guay : the game is fun, it hasn't put me again players that are to high of a lv, some of the levels are a bit unfair but overall, it's a nice game
dustin ottemiller : fun game, reasonably priced in app purchases. appreciate the responsiveness of the dev! suggest adding some detail to the rank section so players can see what's needed to improve rank.
amanda strong : so, are we always playing with an ai or just when it says (ai) in the game? i really want to play with other players. it's really fun. paid for the pro thing, but i'm not sure what i got out of it...
blocksome man 360 : great game. has very simple mechanics and is very easy to use. not too many ads and is truly a hidden gem in the app store.
nah i'm good : the gameplay is alright, which is why i gave it 2 stars. howvere, at times the game is just extremely challenging with not much to do about it.
vuurss_ : it is fun but i don't get why all free games have premium i don't think it's just nessasary why can't you unlock the skin gradient on a level but anyways the game is addictive i love it hope you keep making cool games
ventley's carcass : a great and well developed game with stunning graphics and a decent soundtrack that i've fallen in love with.
jonathan frantz : its a neat game. i found it wasn't pay to win. in the tournaments, am i playing against live opponents? they only seem to become active when i raise the gun
phylock : this game is awful it is stupidly hard to actually hit your opponent and as you go on your enemies gun getts better but yours stays as the worst gun in the game i highly recomend not installing this game as it is a waste of time.
rick boling : satisfyingly different! tournaments and games are quick. easy to earn "coins". random arenas to play in... living room, desert, on a cliff. sometime game play starts with you getting flung in to the arena.. just fun!
dean gonnella : really fun, progression is fun. controls are simple but satisfying.
johnathan hardman : a lot of fun and a great time killer! the different types of gunslinger scenarios.
andrew : this is truly the best game i've played in a long time. the only game i havent uninstalled after a day because how bad it was. this game is very fun and i reccomend fully.
charlie benson : would not recommend to consumers. why because you dont even play with real people just lame bots and the gameplay is not as good as the ads ovobiosly therefore i would give it a 2 star rating only because of the graphics they are pretty well done
victor bacon : it is cool by rating i will give it a 9/10 for the one shooting people it's a really cool game and also hello game devs anyways my game of gunslinger restarted my whole account idk if it's a glitch but i lost everything!
pp pooper : god damm what makes this game even better is that there are no ads when your playing but only ads when you need free coins or extra life and a ad only comes up every 5 mineutes and if you cant support them beacuse you dont have money you can always just play there game and rate it be side that amazing game 10/10 and if it doesn't work ethir you have bad wifi or you probly own a iphone 3 and oh ya if you got money go support them beacuse only with 5 dollars will them make this game better
laura stoner : this game is frickin awesome! my goals were to deafeat lobster bob and get the shotgun and i did it! this game is so fun hope to see more updates in the future..............ps i ta take debuff the shotgun it's to overpowered!
raymalee howard : cute as hell!! fun too! my it problem is that you can't choose the side you shoot from. i'm right handed you know like most of the world. lol good game thoughts
itsthatguy !!! : love the wacky physics and different characters and weapons to mess around with. they pay loads of attention to detail(love the nintendo switch)
slime universe : like this game i really do but sometimes when i play a level i end up getting shot once and falling off i even get spauned fall of the map thanks for reading
oxygen : hello! so ive been playing for a while, and i think we really need a friends list and a way to fight our friends. please add this!
bessecod : this is worth the download! such a cool game, really addictive.. just keep adding more characters and guns please, keep it going. well done!
jon rickell : the 1st part of the 3rd crossbow skillshot challenge bugs out if you shoot too many shots. have to restart the app to refresh/start over.
luisthehipposage : really fun game. i get to shoot little gummy bears and just have fun wasting time. and i have so much to do like getting 3 stars on everything. really fun game.owo
devyne hill : i'm sorry i was just mad at the time but i do like the game a little it was fun playing it one thing i think you guys could add more gun skins and you should add online where you can walk around with you can show off your skin
josh krueger : this game is the perfect combination of skill shots, jelly physics, fun design, unlockables, and zero pay to win! keep it up devs!
ernesto flames : nice concept bad applied... everything or almost everything in the game is real money. this game is pay to get fun otherwise is a waste of time.
marley landress : i am speachless! this game is so eazy to play, and really enjoyable. i literlly play this game all the time, because of how fun it is. its not violent at all and i would highly recomend this for anyone to play!!
gage palmer : pretty good but the only prblem is that when i go up aganst people they so lucky its like i spawn on the edge of the clif and he starts in the middle of tue map and all he has to do us tap me in the knee cap and dead.
ahmed ehab : it's a good game but i paid to earn more guns and i unistalled the game and downloaded it again and i can't find that i paid for anything and i'm keeping pressing "activate cloud save" and nothing happens i want my money back or my load progress back please
joel r : game runs kinda poor. can't make it work the way it's intended. you're dead before you can move your gun half the time. might be my older phone but not a fan.
top notch : disappointed i could be wrong but it looks like there's no way to get new guns unless you pay up it looks like you can't win any guns or buy any guns with the in game coins .am i wrong?
b l : if it put you on your opponent on an even playing field with a countdown it would be a good game. but how are you gonna make it a competitive game when the maps are random and give one person the advantage?
manic tm : i tried and tried to mod and create a patch for this game. but y'all got it locked down tight. i have to give you props for that, good job to the developers
adrian santiago : game has improved. its a lot better than before. more entertaining. great job with the graphics and fixing lag. you guys have redeemed yourselves lol.
notthebest : game is fun really fun but whenever i go to the shop the game bugs with overall and cant buy anything and have to reset every time i try to shop
kiri kins c: : this game is great no adds i'm addicted to this game as well the jelly like move mentions funny lol. but maybe make a choice for left handed ppl? other then that this game is amazing!
josef sedlak : when i started playing this game, i thought its going to be a money grabber, but it turned out to be actually quite good game, i'm still playing it after few weeks despite giving it just few days at first
nou radin : to anyone who wants to download this game, absolutely worth it, i wish there was more games like this, characters are cute, game is simple yet entertaining, just lovef it 5/5 stars.
tyler collins : this game is awesome! its so easy to learn and play. the designer's had a sense of humor and i can appreciate that. not only is it a great way to kill time, i find myself playing when i should be doing other things. it addicting.
jonathan woodcock : i never write these unless the app or game sucks but this game is great i haven't stopped playing it any time i have a couple minutes to spare there's allot of ads but i'm ok with them getting payed
unknown f : despite being a mobile game with a lot of at the game is actually kind of fun do i do have some trouble with the super skill shot but i think people should try this this is a very good game and no i'm not a bot
rodney little : very fun game! 5/5 stars! but when i try to connect to wifi it kicks me outta the game! i hope this is not an issue in the future
lucas lanctot : lol imagine charging for things in a game that literally doesn't work. bullets go through people. you only play ai. terrible terrible trash game. save the time. don't bother with this useless garbage
a.e.i ???? : very fun and addictive game i just wish there were more modes like jumping or like zero gravity would be nice. good game just needs more. also if it was really online pvp how can i play without wifi?
omar limon : trash. pray you can insta kill opponent before they rng a cliff behind your back and u get pushed off the edge with a body shot very interactive.
johan rickus : rip off first of all have to pay to refill health second of all you cant keep guns rip off! i would highly recommend working on these things i mentioned if u dont it should be removed from play store honestly
dan65 l.s. : this game is incredibly cute and simple, i do wish you could duel other people like friends but how the game is rn only cosmetics are paid for so i don't mind.
taras kohut : the game itself is very cool, unique, and is not flooded with ads. but it lags on a flagship phone, how is that possible?
bailey lawson : its a absolutely amazing game iv downloaded 100s of phone games and this is the only one that has captivated me for longer than 15. mins going on 2 weeks playing this !!!
prairie dog : this game is purely fun.... no excessive adds, don't have to pay to win, plenty of free upgrades and lots of fun western duels with various silly guns.
turtlesellingadairyproduct : the game is simple to learn, fun gameplay and great graphics. and the best pa rt is it doesnt shove ads down your throat like most free mobile games
mateo estevez : this game is amazing, i've been playing every single day it's just cool simple but the rewards, the rewards fix everything it is te best game ever
ali raiz : this game has its potential to bring satisfaction to the people who play this and it can really kill time and i really like the setting and set out of this game.
joey martin : its all good, but the challenges are a cheat. i mean come on, hitting a can 3 times in mid-air its a big cheat
dency gomes : i had purchased the app i had a pro version. i changed my device. is there a way to login and jump to my previous save game as i was on level 5. kindly help
ismail shehab : would be cool if the bullet could penetrate the opponent leaving holes, and if it was a critical impact, part of the face rips apart with pieces scattering around.
drew cable : really fun and cute game but...the levels are bery unfair. i literally spawned behind boxes as tall as me. i couldn't even see my character
muhammad afiq azizi : fun and addictive, hard at first but once you get used to the mechanic you good to go.
gesse olausen : i love this game! flubber-like characters and western dueling, what more can you ask for! my only request would be to add a fox character.
gabriel garcia-suarez : i love this game this is a really good game!!! i love the style and physics too! from the cute little guys characters to the east and relaxing mood of the game definitely makes this a 5 star game!!
gacha eric : this game is a bit hard but i love how it is creator if you are reading this can you change one thing for the timer can you still be with the kill people and get to level 3 and stuff
kian croes : its so cool you can get diffrent gummys and stuff i recammond to download this and im not a bot
mack fruck : my bullets go threw the opponent. arrows go right threw. stats are nothing when it's rigged. really guys ?
paul andrei m. padernilla : love the game but it was pay to play its kinda sad that we need to pay just to use some cool guns and all of the time spent waiting and playing it needs to be free for all no pay for guns to play
abel wilson : i would like ut more if the gummy parts would come off
jonathan woodcock : this is tied for my favorite game of here right now it's not p2w and it's fun the controls are ready and the physics are pretty spot on for what's going on in there the only other game that goes a candle to this is guns at dawn
jon ross : got 2 be the funnest game ive played in a long long time, not 2 mention yery addictive. i was late 2 work 3 times because i lost track of time playing gumslinger!
midori c-moon : not laggy, super kid friendly and funny, the game is very satisfying. i can't stop playing , i need help!
joe girdwood : very slick, compelling and fun game. rarely frustrating and generates some great moments.
x_games_x : i couldn't hit the last can on the second level of the first skill shot. fix your game. im a mathematical man and i should of hit the can.
david vizcaino : as fun as this game is, this developer should be flagged for false advertising or something. it claims you are playing again real people. you aren't. it's fun, and i like the concept, but don't lie to your customers.
ningthoujam chandikumar : i rate it one star because i didn,d get stars in level 4
jojonomuskets : quite a fun, physics-based experience, though it is grindy. great fun if you prefer skill and tire of those p2w games.
daniel lujan : this games so cool but when you level up it takes so long so that's why i gave it a 4-star i'll give it a 5-star if if you can update it and let level up faster
toxic void : this game is genuinely fun and a good time passer, and there's slim to no adds, unless you want to watch them. great job devs!
vladitor : it's a fun addicting and easy game, nothing else really to say, haven't seen any bugs, it's a good game overall.
brett adams : i love this game.i cant get enough.i made it to level 11.my phone broke.got a new phone.couldent figure out how.or if i could transfer data.said f it started another .now at level 14.just unlocked my 27th gummer.(death).might i mention only have spent $0.99. $ee ya on the gummy-range.gummers
chris vanriper : fun game until you unlock weapons through progress but can't use them without watching ads for ammo.
kez : staring at a blank screen for ten times longer than i actually get to play. don't even waste your time downloading
the sandefur family : this game sucks. the controls suck. the try hards suck. the whole getup of it sucks. it all just sucks unless you steal your mom's credit card so you can get all the stuff that costs real money.
xerxes : its a great game love the sound track have not found any bugs really good game but i do wish you could change your name. but an awsome game
cowboy brickbattle brick productions : i like the ragdoll physics of the game and the sounds they make when they win or get hurt, but overall this is one of the most additive game i ever played so far
joe chills : put 60fps or i'll just leave this 1 star. your game have the problems not my phone. i'm using huawei nova5t so better check the specs of my phone before saying that. i'm not gonna put feedback if my phone got the issue but it's obviously not.
christian shields : fake multiplayer... i don't appreciate being lied to... and this game tries hard to sell the lie. it pretends like you are playing other players, shows their screen name, rank, and country of origin... but it's all a lie. they even do an internet check at the beginning of a match and say "searching for players" not letting you play if you are offline... but it's all a lie. how do i know? i turned off my wifi and mobile data mid-march and the other "players" continued playing against me...
ryan shaneberger : the devs obviously have no idea what a tournament is. this is a gauntlet not a tournament style game. your health pool doesn't refill yet you play other tournament participants who all have full health. this is a gauntlet not a tournament.
brian hornbubuckle : as a former professional gummy person and gunslinger, i can say without a doubt that this is the most accurate depiction of modern gummy person related gunfights that i have ever seen.
tycho awsumb : this is a good game its entertaining and fun but what i don't understand is the gun picking system when i click to use the shotgun it almost always gives me the wrong gun
austin fisher : honestly just really good. very interesting idea. i feel like i can get headshots too easy sometimes but that's not an issue for me.
lucas bridges : great game and very simple at the same time fun concept too you can make it capable of friending people and being able to play custom games
ikhwan radhi : its really fun to play and i love this kind of game. but i have a questions, the damage chart is a weakness or an advantage?
mark melendy : would like to give it more stars, but it fails to load the second tournament. game seemed fun.
mike larry : it a great game i love it but sometime when you fling into the map you slide of and die and your opponent wins please fix thx.
gamer man : great. not at all too ad heavy, has some humor in it, and had cute little gummy figures to shoot to death! woo! great game!
teresa lopez : poorly made and not a pc or computer or computer system style cream and stuff like that food and the rest of it but it is well known for the whole thing and the other room is a beeping signal for a little bit of time
golden wolf : i mean he is right this game is outstanding it's the best game i had but it could get a few adjustments like 2 player and maybe where you could move and jump easier that's all
jesenia quiles : it's really rare for me to rate but i have to this game is a good game in a long time and it's rare for good games on mobile and this is a great one. keep on going partner!
deklin checketts : this is a hilariously fun game there are so many goofy random shots you can get on opponents and it is also pretty funny to have a pizza standoff in the middle of a desert
joshua smith : i love this game because games it's so addicting. my rate is a 5 whoever made this and who helped it's just amazing you can create a such cool game out of to guys dueling it's amazing.
naveen v : not online game. no pvp or any of those things the game claims. initially they keep (ai) in player tag to trick us.. later they remove the ai tag making us think you actually playing with other people. it's a great game and all.. but everything is runied after i found out i've been playing against bots all the time. i regret spending money to buy the pro version. and i'm so so glad i didn't buy those heavy coin bundles in shop.. i mean who would pay real money for a offline game? 0
harshit rawat : i have all skins unlocked and it's very additive game but please add a feature of playing with gun you want that you have unlocked and remove that random gun feature you get to play. (make it possible to play with only the gun you selected)
lucas andreev : i dont like this game. the opponents keep on killing me and you need like 82 stars to get to the next level, i dont get a single star. uninstalling.
brody barr : game is unfair, skins have different hitboxes even though they should all have the same hitboxes, it's hard to unlock stuff.
cyrus lee : cool guns, cool skins i like it because it has cool guns
baby hadez : smooth controls great graphics and very fun gameplay and there are not too many adds they should add bullet penetration though
mukul singh : best game...so funny and full of action...i like that cute background music the most. and also the wigglyy thing. keep building more games like this.
feral kitten : ad skip to next level sometimes does not load and cannot be reselected after rebooting game.
sean kofman : it is a fun game that has no adds. i like it and it's a great time waster but it gets old before you even reach level 2.
gihan perera : graphics a+ quick draw premise is fun but menus are confusing and hand progression is ???. not uninstalled though
crazy croc : a very nice game to kill time and enjoy yourself but the only problem is having to watch and ad to use another weapon aside from the revolver otherwise i would've given a 5 star rating
mystic guy675 : this is not fair because the health after i get shot is not regenerate,i need spend my money to make healthy again,and when i play offline the ai is fully healed i think this is not fair.this is a bad game,i really don't like this game
fireking gaming : each of the bots start with full life while you loose some each round. this game is not vary realistic for bots that are suppose to act like people.
ryn64mobile : this is the only gunslinger game i play.the graphics look good ,the controls is easy really a great game keep it up
thefancy thunderfox : it was the best gunslinging game i habe ever played the affects are good and the characthers are amazing my fovorite is the sword fish guy i just wished the the gun skins are with money but they have to earn money somehow but best game im addicted to it
sykiter lol : i love it ! i something to add could you please add a google play sign in button cuz i purchased the "pro" version and reinstalled the game and now i can't sign in to my account nor to get the "pro" version
david bridges : makes you watch videos to "load your gun." i originally gave it 1 star, but the dev team gave a respectable reply. i hope you manage a better way. good luck.
m z : i like this game but hopefully in the next update the bullets can pentrate the players to make it more fun and realistic and like adding a jelly water when the bullet pentrate the player
gretchen maslowski : i love this game for some reason it's just so satisfying the physics are... great and it is so fun to rank up the rewards are cool and gameplay is 10/10
kjhhbhh : this game is really good. i wish some skins were free and there was a system where you could battle friends
raj bhavsar : outstanding game...i really appreciate with this game...i like graphic and control very much..i hope new feature adding as soon . thank you
tyler miller : your character just ducks and jumps around for no reason and it's hard to control anything when this happens, just hope the ai misses
david gilbreath : the ads are too frequent and way to long. the game play is otherwise great.
da llama : was a very fun game. i enjoyed it very much. then, one day when i opened the app, i lost all my progress and in app purchases. i reached out for help and never got a reply .
erma alvarez : this is the best game all the skins and stuff no crash so op
bud the green : the game steals your money! i was playing this game on my second device and i thought, why not i'll buy the pro features and then next thing i know it logs into my google play and gets rid of my pro features. i then tapped on a pro feature and it made me try to buy it again. i thought, well i'll try get a refund but i'll buy this atm just because i actually feel like playing and then it says i have already purchased this feature. i don't have access to them and it has taken $6 from me!
dylan lucas : i love the game, don't get me wrong, but the only issue i have with this is the fact i have to watch ads to reload my weapon of choice. until that is fixed, 3 out of 5
patrick keller : epic adventure of reaction time and accuracy. awesome random charecter unlocks, nice gun levels, and cool skins.
oofyoofoof : ummm idk bout this game, there's too many things yet to little, everytime i play this i fall into a deep dark pit of depression, that i can never escape. i think tricky did it.

connor munro : i like the game but it switching me to the revolver if i'm on a different gun.
francisco campos : very fun. much higher quality than 99% of free games. i even bought some stuff in the first da yh of playing. i hope to see more games like this.
j3 freddie cunningham iii : great game! my only wish/suggestion is a 3,2,1 countdown with real 1v1 gameplay so i could play with friends! otherwise its fantastic
misael gonzales : i love this game so much ,winning a ranked duel mach is so satisfying the way the game is built it is sleek and cute!! i would be on board for gumslingers 2!
david smiley : very cool but us 1 handed desparados cant play... can i get a 1 handed mode?
ethan deneweth : this game was really fun. i just don't play games on my phone anymore. keep up the amazing work. you should try making a battle royale or something out of this. it would be amazing.
proxifyx : love the game, but somebody doesn't have to spend money to have all of these gun skins and stuff. i recommend this game to a lot of people and i love this game a lot!!!
gavin 1335 : its really fun i don't really take time to rate a game but the only thing is i wish you made a button where you can jump and crouch
george hack : one of the best games to play when you have free time
2747 savale vedant : too many ads
stevslayer : needs controller support
noah selwood : this is a horrible game and the controls are impossible to use also the game can glitch out and you have to log out completely to fix it
walter johnson : fun kind of but def a pay to win game but fun... also i wish it was a real pvp game in real time. you can pause the game while playing so its obviously not true pvp but oh well still decent
harry stead : this is a great game but i wish that we could unlock the gun skins and not by them and that we have to watch an ad to use the guns we've unlocked
james norman : one of the best new games i've played. funny. fast. hard but easy enough to understand for kids. really a great game
jullian danar : this game is the worst
jewmoneyxl : wonderful and easy to get into
r.h.m : dumbest gameplay ever the damage system is beyond dumb (basically when you hit someone on their back it does minimal damage as when you hit them on the chest ) and the jumping is the worst part so dumb
dsmshot yt : yo the game its real graet fun but there is some problem in online first round is laggy in secon round its go smooth and random lags in game its need improvment in online but its great game must install thank you for great work !
wa kiri bland : this game is a great time killer. the physics make the game funny and exciting to play and there isn't too much grinding involved
hejsshevd : the guns is realy not stable when you fall down and its very hard to aim. i will give 5 star if fixed.
tom : great game solid gameplay with an amazing progression system, because it diddnt shove microtransactions down my throat and the gameplay was fun i actually bought pro.
michael engen : well, i would rather have my wisdome teeth pulled again. game is damn near impossible to pass level two. that kinda sucks! but oh well... just uninstalled.
eliza livine : borked and unfair, heavily pay-to-win - also keeps sending notifications to remind me i haven't uninstalled yet, doing so now.
axl : pretty fun game ngl
game masters : it's a really fun game except sometimes my bullets will go through the enemy and its kinda anoying.
phillip sharpe : you know what, it's a good game, the controlls are solid, the adds are not bad,and it can be played both offline and online
nicolas moeljanto : this game is amazing, first time playing it instantly bought the pro version, worth every penny, more weapon please, and would love to see some zen mode
mohammad najm : hilarious game which is well made and fun to play! the simplicity of the game is the main catching point and the hilarious music is just a plus
nasrullah anwar : fun gun dueling and trick shotting with adorable gummy characters. cosmetics cost real world money but it isn't a pay to win.
tiegan anderson : it is kinda fun, but it is really confusing, also it takes forever to level up.
kendo hanlon : it's so good the graphics are briliant
keanu x : nothing wrong with graphics or gameplay but the controls is like trying to control a person falling
what yeah : fun game, but i don't believe you're playing against actual people. also you never manage to achieve the money and health at the same time. the app will make you lose in order to stop you.
christopher gibson : great little gem of an app. excellent quickdraw gun slinging fun and splendid ragdoll physics all wrapped up in one neat easy to play package. six stars all day long
iwillgetchannelsoon juatez : i really love this game! this game reminds me of me playing a timmy's life! but now in mobile but shooting addition? i love the design's !!

cherie gombocz : no adds unless you get an add on purpose for coins. good graphics. and very fun!
carson gould : would be a great game if it wasn't made to milk players out of their money at every second. the game doesn't allow you to heal between fights unless you pay, why is that a feature??
jasen green : like the game, it's a lot of fun but i got a new phone and there is no cloud save so i lost all my progress and pro starter pack.
veronica gutierrez : this is the game that tests your reflexes you have to be faster then fast to win it has a good reward system every duel is intense
nathanael aldo : this game.. though its simple but its addictive! the sfx and music are cute as heck. i even bought the pro pack becuz... well... its too cheap tbh... but this game worth my money so why not
chris bogan : even though it seems a little childish it's definitely a great gun game old west-style just point name and keep shooting till whoever drops first drops first lol also a great stress reliever
khaled asfour : great game ...although you must pay to get the premium items ..they are still worth it.otherwise it is incredible game and i am having a lot of fun playing it .
cesar anthony : i give gumslinger 4 stars because for me it lags but other than that the graphics are great the controls are great and the game is great.
damian catalan : i love the game there is not really any problems it's fun and it is a really good way to pass the time in 2020 because of the virus and everyone is at home nothing to do i really encourage you to download this game
daner adnan : this games awesome but it needs a ragdoll buttong i like i like being ragdoll
shakti shakti : this game is amazing but you need to add some new gunslinger , multiplayer mode , some more levels and some more gun
jonathan goulet : love playing it
flex low : bug on the shop i found a bug where everytime i open shop the game will stuck and cant show anything, i have to reopen the game again to make it work pls fix this, this is so annoying
johan jinoh : very cool game but the levels is so hard when your new you your round 32 im noob the but i have the shout gun im pro for it if you want i can play skill shout or random guns right if you want gun fight game download this game its so good
gregory annicchiarico : i'm giving this 5 stars for the jules jackson gunslinger alone! hysterical nod to samuel l jackson and pulp fiction. the catchphrase, although still bumbled jargon, is unmistakeable!!
american : this game isnt like most mobile games, there are less ads and that is one of the best things about this game, i have been playing it for a couple of hours and its really good!
dino soup : its so fun for about 5 seconds but then the enemies are just rigid and the damage makes no sense
sougata roy : one the most funniest and cute game ... please add multiplayer mode.. not some random players but friends it will be great don't ignore..
tinmangaming : it sucked the developer has no brain the guns are garbage and the controls fix them bullets don't travel that slow and the ai always lands head shots
kirk grayson : smooth animation, fluid gun play, no lag, plus a simple fun game. i do enjoy it.
no : would you please fix the damn hit detection? the game would be easy if it actually worked and the bullets didn't go through stuff
mrabtw : should add movement mechanichs but amazing game
alex paez : seems ok so far. trying to figure out why i'll sometimes hit an opponent and it'll do little or no damage.
robert chapa : this game is good like i enjoy it but i got some problems 1 : for soem reason the game makes you think its online when it isnt the usernames are ment to lie and thats is also why do we need a username cant we jaut use player 1 i wanna talk more but there isnt really aprob but we need online ok
giovanni menendez : it's so fun! good time killer and you can play offline but you have to duel bot fine with me though. five stars, the game deserves it.
k4the4d : so many things you need to fix up! edit - add some extra mechanics, like gummies being ripped apart when shot, etc.
brian o_o : it's a great casual fun game if you want to kill time and also it can get pretty competitive at times just great really do recommend this game
zalo 1300 : this game is cool, but it would be better if it had online pvp. another idea armor that fans off if shot. i wish i could play with friends
tamara mozley : fun time waster. easy to get started and linear goals. i like it!
projectiv : the game is good funny and doesnt have alot of bugs but if you put your finger or cursor on his head again and again you have aimbot i think you should patch this somehow its way to op
h h : its a fun game. its cute too. i think its a great game. i just dont like that i cant use other weapons without the pro version.
f a c e face : if you want to be a best gun slinger of all games, you should try this because its so good graphics and easy control try it now.
karthik ramaprasad : so good game but remove the ads
chris king : the sounds are funny. the game is fun and they don't ad you to death. they try to sell you their stuff but you can still easily win without buying. you can't get mad at them for trying to make money. i want these guys to make money. maybe more game creators will follow being less greedy.
raguver bhat : pretty good the game does get tougher and the wobbling body is an nice addition to the difficulty levels!! nicely done!! bravo!!
abdulrahman mustafa : i like the game but there is no cloud save !!! so one time i had the format the phone but when i installed the game again i had to start all over
matthew gaughan : hilarious and engaging gameplay menu can get slightly confusing especially in the early stages of the game
eric lamoureux : cool! pretty fun game. it would be nice if there was a clock/counter to see how much time left for the daily reward. thanks for the reply.
steamedbreakfast : this game is a work of art. the jelly physics, the funny sound effects, everything is on point. perfect.
s420blazeitnow : it's good, i just wish it wouldn't lag so much when i start the tournaments as well as why do you need to watch an add for a gun you just unlocked?
chandon : the pro mode made me a bit disappointed, i had initially thought the game was free. other than that though, it's pretty good!
kenan ljaljevic : rewarded video ads are not being shown and i still get a reward. great for the users, but not for the developers...
grim coffee gaming : its soooooo stupid legit best thing ever dude the concept is amazing its designed for short to long play time to really maximize play time and demographic well done btw im 15 and is smart when it comes to this stuff must play game right here
nithya l : itatake this game is awesome dude i like the sharif crab character i like the machine gun this game totally awesome. thank you itatake for making this game i like it thank you so much
g.w. : fantastic animation quality not to hard, not easy, and still entertaining. but if the duels are against bots the why do some of the bots have racial slurs in the names?
alex w : i absolutely love this game, it became my favourite when the boss update got released, i also love the music, very funny, ads does not appear if i don't want to watch it for reward, also the game is not p2w because you can only buy cosmetic items only pro gives you more rewards from star bar but that isn't a big advantage.
gavin c : excellent very fun! great time killer and i appreciate that you can still play offline. definitely worth it.
paul phillips : great laugh , not too many ads ,definitely a keeper , best app i've played in a long time.
quirino agbayani : i love this game and it's so cool yeah it's getting so cool like but when you lose can't wait for the effect on it man don't mean the world to me i know so search up astronaut in the ocean remix best one is the asian one man now one is good the one where you study and you don't sleep sounds good you should really search that up and also love the game man i rated it a five-star have a great day peace and also your game really sucks yeah sorry though that's my brother he like doesn't he loves the
jaimie northington : worst game ever 1 way to many adds 2 me and my opponent died at the same time and i thought i would win but i lost i would rate it 0 if i could
jack blue : awesome gummy action bounce your way into top gunslinger!!!! plenty of tasks in a fun bouncy format, collect all the gummies and shoot your way to the top.
tarek ghonem : the game is great expect i am playing against bots i feel i am faster than them they really not real players also part about medkit why i have to paid every time 100 to get other one this must be fair game no need to medkit we have full health at beginning of every match.
squiggleman : i have been having trouble with the store, as in nothing will lod and it says "nothing is currently available, please check back later" and yet i've waited a year and still nothing. but there's one thing that makes that up. bum gum. best goshdurn saying ever. still need help with the store, though.
robert mcevoy : it is pretty cool but the skins and guns take to long to unlock and you have to buy most of the really good stuff witch i am not allowed to do
joel smith : great game, not pay to win (finally) , just pay to not have adds. devs gotta make $, i feel it's a fair trade.

5e1p no 1if3 : funny and happy basically bowmasters but in the wild west and better if u have a child that likes shooting games and want to still look like a child's game this is a game i would recommend
bubbleutuna taint : there is no online play that was a lie test for yourself players all you have to do is at the beginning of battle simply do nothing and you will soon see that the enemy also does nothing that is until you shoot or move so yeah thanks for lying to us guys
