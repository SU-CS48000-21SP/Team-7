Scott Golat : Just a fun 5 second gummy splatting time. That turns into 30 minutes.....
cheezy cheddar : There's nothing really to say its a very fun game and very easy mechanics
J Kill : Love playing this game nice graphics fun game play cool guns and characters and different mini games
Cory C : Fun game but you need to fix the stuff that gets in the way. Its not needed on every duel, it makes it so there is no way one of the characters can hit the other.
Ok : This game I dope as hell. It's fun and I like the stupid way the characters talk. 10/10🤑😎
blancoblaeko k : 2nd time playing the game. And it's way better than before. Recommend playing. 5 stars
Laura Maxson : I kept on losing on the super skill-shot I can't shoot the can up in the air three times 😡😠🤬😡😠🤬😡😠🤬😡🤬😠😡😠🤬😡🤬🤬😠🤬😡🤬😡🤬😠😡👿👿👿👿👿👿👿😾😾😾😾💢💢
Mr. Pringles : Yeah yeah iknow its gud but i cant have some skins without my money they should add skins you can buy with your coins.
sara Smailes : It sucks because it doesn't work the crossbow suck and same as the punch gun.
jahquez reddick : Awesome more online and more power ups/level ups on guns and armor.
Dale Kelly : Really fun the level up system is a bit sloppy.
Isaac Roberts : Amazing. Simply amaziny so many guns so many characters.I believe in u I TA TAKE team.Keep going
evilrobot454 : Great fun, easy to picknplay and comeback to. no over push on selling which nice

Tushar Salunke : One of the best games Very simplistic and easy to play
Augustin Țopai : Very entertaining and it trains your accuracy and dexterity quite well
Jacob Walsh : I'm not a mobile gamer, but this is the most fun mobile game I've played in a while.
Mohammad Abotogar : Very good game, creative and designed for mobile phones in mind
Viraj Singh : best game ever ! The graphics are the best graphics ever and it's free I love it I superbly recommend this I love it so much 💜 😍 ❤ ♥ 💕 💖 💜 😍 ❤ ♥ 💕 💖 💜 😍 ❤ ♥ 💕 💖 💜 😍 ❤ ♥ 💕 💖 💜 😍
robert lefebvre : I paid for pro version changed phones and i guess its not for ever like it says
Isaiah Tomoana : Really Cool game, honestly one of the only mobile games I kept on my phone and regularly come back too
Rhonda Perrin : I loved it it just took lots of work to practice with the cross bow
Eric_tha_ alien : The game is amazing and a good time killer it's fun and challenging and if you don't get pro ads don't pop up as much but I do wish they had more customizable options.
Benjamin Williamson : It's one of the only mobile games I actually enjoy! Simple, fun, low on the constant advertising and asking to pay real money on everything. It runs well too, even in my crappy phone. It's great!
Dale Britt : Very fun! I love the sound and the animation.
Gabe Johnson : Awesome game! Simple to play & very addicting! Good job guys
Timo Torres : It's a fun game I love this game of shooting and make more games and gunslinger Is the best
Arthur Haleta : Amazing game, with very few ads, which are also skippable. The graphics are great, I dont know what else to suggest, the game is perfect.
Jay Jones : This game is great! It's simple and so enjoyable. Ads are minimal. What better way to pass the time and blow off some stress than slangin guns and ammo at candy figures. Hats off to the creators. You guys nailed it right here ! Download this app! You won't regret it!
Fawzee Emmamdeen : The best game I've played in a while! Everything is spot on, the animations, the physics of the game, the music and little sounds, I love it! Keep up the good stuffs 👌🏼
Swarnali Banerjee : Just the game I needed. Or anyone who likes arcade-genre games. Superb graphics, cute characters and sounds, super satisfactory gameplay. It's a 10/10 from me.
lemon head : This game is kinda nice not like any game cause it can make fighting scenarios like I once fought a guy with gun he shot at me but I jumped behind the table and he jumped too put there were cliffs on the map and he graped the cliff and I all hail the king and shot him lol whatever but little gameplay with these scenes that you make up in your head are pretty cool so I think this what makes the game so neat and if you are reading this I think you should download the game
Jasmine T : This game is a great time killer. It's fun, random and satisfying. Especially, when you're having a bad day it feels good to shoot some jellies. The characters are colorful and silly. I think my favorite is Mando who nuzzles baby Yoda when he wins.
Luke Sunner : The graphics are brilliant along with the gameplay and there is a lot of variety. I wish there was an easier way to access the other guns. Still a brilliant game.
mangles vlogs FNAF 2 : The game is good but at least make it where you can actually press the gun that you want to play as the entire game that you like and least add that to update 3 or 2 like Elise make it a update where you could have pressed the shotgun and that would mean that you would have the shotgun the entire round so you don't have to worry about getting the pistol or something and there'd be a button cold random and it would randomize the guns make that an update please
Sebastian Spellman : This game is hilarious! You do not understand how happy I am that this game is being updated! The new bosses are fun and look great. Hoping that more are added! There's so many things too do. You can get all skins, complete all the levels, grind bosses or just mess around with the loveable jelly fighters! Developers, expect a donation 👍🏻
Ivory Sherrod : Love the game and I thought I'd say it. However the shooting system allows for some odd moments where you shoot past the enemy.
Sparko Octavian : Very stylish and cool game without pay to win and easy to control. A wonderful time killer, also offline. Only I have a question: is it possible to play against friends? If not, will it be?
Paul Carmichael : It is overall a fun game I really love the jelly like characters my only problem with it was the level missions where you have to do challenges to proceed to the next level I spent 2 hours just doing the 4th challenge the other challenges only took 5mins-10mins Please nerf the challenge
Brian Lemus : This is a very fun game. I bought the most expensive go pro and I was not given what I bought. **Update** The devolper got im touch with me and we talked about the issue. He was super helpful and showed me where I misunderstood. Extremely happy now.
Henry Hill-Liles : You need money to play the whole game like you get a tutorial and that's it I got no money to pay so
the pizza : Fun game and very good art style the gameplay is amazing i would recommend
Holy Roman Sloth : The game is a good concept but the controls are terrible. No matter how carefully you slide your finger the arm flys all over the place.
Anthony Cordio : Pretty fun game! Different concept.
Kyle Anderson : I very rarely rate an app, much less a game, but the lack of frequent ads and having engaging gameplay and fun aesthetic makes this really worth downloading to pass time.
Mr. Tommy : Super fun great game but there's a lot of thing ads
Nick Forsyth : Game is awesome so far. Love the smooth movement! Gunplay seems great! Great concept! Need to find a way to battle friends in real time with betting on matches!
Paul Songer : Absolutely phenomenal game. The ads are few and far between, which is the biggest reason I stuck around. The game is simple and fun, while still very challenging. I can't stop playing.
S.R. Sarwono : The game is so buggy when you have reached the higher level. They make you lose the game on purpose, even if you shot at the enemy's weak point!
Gerardo Ibarra : Awful collition detection, cool concept but could've been coded better. Good if you're gonna play it like one time on a bus or something, not to keep for a long time.
Manikin manikin : It's really fun just wish there was more complex levels
Michele Barber : I love this game and I play it all the time.This game has a lot of characters and tons of levels and lots of things to do. I love all the gun skins, backgrounds, and all the challenges and levels.Overall it is a great game and I recommend downloading it.
The Flex : Bro this game is aggrevating. The aiming, the props glitch, and the aim bot for the bots dude. Especially when my enemy lays down behind a couch it wont let me shoot him anyway, but he shoots me headshot. This game really can get aggrevating even for my friends, im not hating i do like it (thats why im playing it) but it sometimes gets on my nerves 😂
Bobu : Not a bad game but disappointed when I realised that the other players are just AI. As soon as I knew, it was obvious. Wish that developers wouldn't fake games as multiplayer when they're not. I'm confused about all the super positive reviews for this game given that surely most people realise that the game isn't really multiplayer.
Ramil Roosileht : I like how simple the UI is and how arcadey the controls are. The game really doesn't ask a lot from you and is enjoyable to play in quick sessions.
miles_witha_ y : Good game and concept but the whole reward system is confusing at first and then it just ends up to be not worth it. There are basically no rewards so no motivation to play this game
Maydi Golindano : GREAT AND EPIC GAME! This game is so good. I LOVE the concept of instead of normal people it's like gummies Instead. I also like how there is SO MANY CHARACTERS TO CHOSE FROM! This game is one of the best gun games out there! Thank you for this game.
Peter Dyers : This game is amazing, I've thoroughly enjoyed playing it! The developers should be so proud, the in game purchase aspect is well conceived and the game runs so smoothly and is so engaging. If the developers want to get in touch then please provide me with an email as I'd love to tell you more. Best game on the play store!
Roy Dalio : Great time waster! The controls are really fluid and once you get the hang of it it's fun! So much that I paid for pro and a paid skin 🤣 can we play with friends please.
M : Everytime i load in a game it show's up a ad when i go in 1 time, it does not appear and when i go in a second time, it show it up i hate ads, can u remove ads from the game because annoying and i will rate it 5 stars
Martin Kovachki : Game is pretty polished and there's a lot to do. One huge downside is no realtime pvp. That is needed as soon as possible. I don't want to fight other players accounts on AI
OREO : It's a very nice game but I feel like it's missing something special.But if you could add like a aiming laser of some sort because the controls are a bit clumsy,otherwise great game.
Barna Hegyi : After I wanted to play the game for the second time it wouldn't load.I mean the logo and the audio is ok but after it loads to 100% on the top right it goes to a orangeish background and that's all...I tried to close the game and restart and to restart my phone but nothing...I actually liked the game and give a 5 star but whit this bug it's 1. I don't want to lose my 3 and a half hour of progress 😢😟
AutoAimBotBoy : The game is fun but it's going a bit too hard whet the micro transaction. And of course it has it's fair share of bugs caus game is 3D but controls are made for 2D game.Over all a relly fun game i enjoy playing it a lot.
SoloAztec : Great game! Just a lot of ads.
ChillzEntertainment : The tournament is rigged. Headshots do lots of damage. I shot my enemy 6 times in the head and he shot me once in tge head and I lost. Also, the timed sections are absurd.
Kevin van der Wal : Seems like a fun game. Not bad. I thought the menu and buttons to press in it were a bit user unfriendly. And it is pretty eager to show you paid features. But it isnt a bad game at all.
PRODESTROYER 4 : It is so good! I mean like the rag doll physics are just the best and after I got the shotgun I was like(0-0) It is op! and the different characters and skins add a whole new VARIETY, I LOVE IT!
Aiwais Ali : Hi, it is a great game, however, I purchased the Pro mode, but I haven't received anything in return? The only thing that happened was the ads were removed. Bit lost here, did the upgrade to Pro not involve getting more skins or guns?
Pete Cheacker : Luvly gelly fx but cheezy kiddy sfx, a very fun to play shootemup, cool random online competitors, Weird weirdly weirdo wazzz!!!
Oogabooga OokOok : Pay to use a gun or watch an add. Aim a little high, even if it's just a slight change your shot is missed. Need to wait an hour or more to move to the next rank. How shite is this.
iPlayEverything : What a game. how did you get this idea? FUNtastic game. feedback: Add more skins for characters, the gold skin for guns awesome. so add more skins for characters. by the way, i am a PRO member now. thanks for the low price and onetime price instead of weekly, monthly recurring memebership. Good luck for future updates.
Nachogaming Macho : Best game ever played!!!! I love the lobster Sheriff character. Awesome 😀!!!!!!!!
Blazzing_fire 34 : To describe what I think is a really good thing this game has wacky physics and it's fun to lose and win I'd say 100% without a doubt download it. It's very addictive and you might say mobile games aren't that good but this one is almost as good as fortnite and lots of people love fortnite it's as good as my fav game Roblox the creators I appreciate how much time and effort you put in this game. After all I love cartoon violence and this brings it to a new level thank you 🙂!
Kurt Gam : Super fake AF! The game is alright so far, but the whole "pvp" is a lie. There is no multi player mode. The first game you play is training, no real players, okay fair enough, but from then on, the game just removes the "AI" from their names. Example: [AI] Jim ----> Jim] There are no real players, I know this as fact because the enemy "player" never, EVER draws their weapons before you do. I could go to sleep, and wake up with the AI still waiting for me to draw. Also the game is laggy AF.
Paul Johnson : Could be a perfect 5 starts... - don't like the health system, should be full health/ fair for all each fight - can't stand the moving skill shoots, might be just me but I'll never get the bloody trophies 😭
Pepe Kube : So funny, so refreshing. I wish there was more games like this in the Play Store. You can easily tell that this game is actually well thought through and very well executed, can't quite recall when was the last time I felt so addicted to an Android game. And I have to laugh at all those reviews saying "oh you need to spend money on this game". Well guess what folks, the people developing these games actually have jobs and bills to pay too, yet you still want to enjoy their efforts for free? This one is definitely money well spent and I'm sure the fun won't stop anytime soon :)
Epicman99 : The game is a funny idea, but it's wayy too hard, I found out that you need to spend currency to get full heal, I feel like this is a pay to win game... It's also really hard to aim, it's like snail racing, they keep beating me!
Logan Hysell : Very fun and easy to learn game
Randomize Person : It's fun, looks good, and I love the bouncy ragdoll physics. Can get a little frustrating sometimes, but it might just be because i'm not that good at aiming. Great job.
Kayan Hamdan : It is a very fun game. Barely no ads.
Jad Masri : I like the game, but it doesn't make sense that my HP remains the same across all the duels, unless I refill using 100 coins (2 ads to refill HP once) or of course, pay for it. Bottom line is that it's indirectly a pay-to-win game, which I'll pass on..
Reid Clanton : Once you get the aiming down it's pretty easy to hit the enemy then you just have to buy hit points and guns to win. Pay to win game if you're cool with that.
Jonathan Schulz : Very fun animations and sounds. Simple premise, aim best but it's extremely entertaining with a ton of fun colorful characters and weapons.
Matthias Beboux : Very Fun ! Great Idea, love the graphics, the sounds, and the "finishing moves / win gestures". Even loosing get's me to smile or even laugh out loud.
ToppyCuppy : The game has really good graphics, I like that you can change the graphics but I have one concern I wish it had a gun aiming sensitivity but overall it's a really great game.
Pillowcow2010 : I think it is a good game to play, highly recommend. I had no problems whatsoever.
Wombat Steve : The game offered me multiplayer, Google store says the this is an offline experience. Google is correct, I turned my connection off and "multiplayer" works just fine. EDIT: Thank you for the explanation!
Joey West : Best darn root'n toot'n shoot'n game roun these here hills partner. So join the rest, come on out to the West, put your quest to the test, and see if you are the Best....
Clay Wells : Level 4 skillshot 2 is overly difficult in comparison to the rest of them which is incredibly frustrating. Needs toned down. Did you guys increase enemy damage and or decrease damage taken? Went from decent tournament win rate to a win rate of 1-2 duels all the sudden. Can't win a tournament even with a full health kit when I was winning them before with no health kit. This is my experience with all guns now. Bleh
W. D. : This game rocks or jiggles. Either way it's fun to play. Wish there was a tournament for big Rewards. Like gun skins or special effects. Can't wait for new upgrades. Great job guys!
Suraj Mundhada : Great game , but u should add multiplayer option for playing with friends... Bluetooth or online connecting friends, tournament option for friends ... That will bring two more stars to the game
kyle vincent : This game is very well made the only thing I would add is a friend system so you can verse your friend (edit) i have just got a new phone and my pro membership has not been carried over if you could get it back that would be nice and I cant buy it again because I already have it so it would be nice to get it back
FearsomeGem : The game is fun at first when your firing ai's but some levels in the torments are impossible you get knocked down if you get shot and there are rocks in the middle of the arena so when you get shot down and there's a rock you lose, ai's always do more damage
00 : Thank you so much also plz add 2 players in one phone if u want to also I love your game keep it up also here is ideas for gumslinger arena mode is when 1 to 10 players 1v1 to see who's the last person standing and zombie mode is 1 player shooting zombies and have to battle level to levels and have to defeat all the zombies at the end the player have to battle a zombie boss.
Somar Alraheb : Fun game! However, they should definitely add lan and online duels instead of just fighting bots. Also, although you can get many different gumslingers for free, all skins are locked behind paywall, at least make a few of them purchasable through coins. I'll keep an eye on Gumslinger in hopes of it reaching its true potential in PvP, not PvPb.
Vikram AVN : Lovely sounds and animation. Engaging gameplay 👌 ♥️ ♥️ ♥️
Jordan : It's a fun game and well worth 0 yen. But I was sitting through ads thinking I had to be online to meet my next global opponent. Some, by the way, had funky names. Alas, I was saddened when I realized they were bots and I couldn't gum down real Americans, sigh. Lost a star for that.
M C : Seemed fun at first but it's obvious that you're meant to pay in order to do anything other than first game mode. Has potential to be fun but it gets boring fast unless you pay.
Ciccioforchetta 88 : Game is awesome, entertaining and simple, great graphics and barely any ad. Only thing missing is the replay (with slowmo would be a 7 star game) of the actions pleeeease
Carson Shaffer : There is so much pay to win in this game that it is disgusting. You can't even unlock new guns without buying them. Also don't get me started on the grammer issues throughout the entirity of the game. Had potential and the developers got greedy.
Leana : great but make it so when u shoot ur oppoment little bits of gum flys all over the place and I hate how U can't use a shotgun U have watch ads to use shotgun and sometimes the game will change my weapon To a revolver which sucks😠 and the skill shot is so dumb because when u shoot something it goes through they can be pretty impossible sometime I don't know if U guys have actually tested the levels to see if they are possible 😬
Neel Gohel : Good game.. two things i missed in the game...1st..why dont you add local network multiplayer mode.. 2nd..please add to allow play with friends..with common platform using your own or using social media platforms.
Legendary Llama : Very fun game.A little dumb sometimes,but it is fun
Memeious Extremeious : The game itself is so damn fun to me, the physics, the sound, and the games art style are something to enjoy. Those damn physics are something I tell ya.
Jake Benedict : Its a quick fun game, but it really is just bots. When a duel starts, they only move after you touch the screen. They'll stand there as long as you will and never move a gummy muscle. For passing time, its great, but don't sell me a pvp dueling game and only put me against bots like so many other companies. Its a shame.
Jason Higgins : I actually really like this game. I even paid for the pro version. Unfortunately I have to give it a low rating because I've just discovered that pro only lasts for a couple of levels and then you have to pay again. I would suggest being up front about this. Sadly, I will be uninstalling Gumslinger. I will also remove RIP from the same developer. I really don't like these tactics. Update: The developer has listened to the complaints about upgrading to pro and has made changes. Thank you!
zuber : I have redmi k20 pro with 855 flagship processor. All games runs smoothly in my mobile. This is the first time, i am having a trouble playing a game. You need to fix the game it's laggy. Otherwise it's great. Please optimize the game as soon. As possible. It's so laggy
Henrique Peixoto : Despite the paid content the game is awesome. It has simple, but very good graphics and the menus are easy to understand.
93Gremlin93 : Like the improvements but the daily reward system seems a bit counter intuitive. The first 6 days have a consistent avarage between 600 and 700 but the seventh day reward varies differently between 500,1000 and 1500. 1000 and 1500 makes sense but 500 is less that what I would get any other day. Getting 500 after a week of logging in is rather demotivating if I can get more from loosing the streak
Ivy Alers : Game is so cool but so hard give me every single character and I might like it more please I'm coming everyone about this game
Nathan TABLET : Pretty good, even though there's ads. I still like this
Tyler O'Donnell : Great game, lots of potential but a few problems, like bullets passing through the enemy without dealing damage which seems to happen every dual
derp cwota : I liked the ads of this game cause they looked interesting but after playing the game i immediately give this game a 1 star because this game is super pay to win when you're in a with 64 and the numbers go down you will lose health and then the game will tell you to buy a health pack for 100 coins which is unfair since most of the people who get 1st place are pay to win noob's Edit: ok after going back to the game it isnt that bad its just the massive p2w Edit 2: now its going to a 2 star
Ethan Warren : I get the first shot off, man's half health on the ground, "Easy win" I think to myself.Boy was I wrong. So I empty my mag into his head as he is lying on the floor bleeding out.But to no avail, he somehow skillfully doges them all like neo from the matrix(All while on the ground).He quickly becomes tired of my futile efforts in killing him and simply shoots me in the head with the accuracy of a smart pistol off titanfall 2.The headshot damage at times seems too irregular, and am I facing bots?
3NVY B1GHUNGR33 : Epic game... not sure what everybody else is talking about in their reviews this game does not lag and is actually really fun to play and I've leveled up very quickly I don't really understand why people are giving it bad reviews my only issues are I wish that there were more characters and that you didn't have to buy the pro version in order to unlock skins and other weapons permanently aside from that add more characters and guns please I think you're doing a great job
Jayden Plays : Ok I will tell you what I think is wrong. the update said "use other guns for free" and I did not get anything. And that is the only problem was I being mean in the other one? If yes then I apologise. Edit1: Hi again. Ok so someone had a revolver and shot me in the head and I died and when I got the game looking in the reviews you said two shots from a revolver is a knockout so I think a bug happened in the update.
Adri : Some maps are borderline unfair. Why do i get spawned behind boxes with my head exposed while my enemy doesnt is beyond my comprehension. The jumping mechanics is borderline dumb since you cant control it. I lve lost multiple times because i autojumped into my enemys bullets that weren't supposed to hit me. Health mechanic is just another cash grab. Why do i need to waste money to get my health replenished?
sean vaughan : The game itself is alright the mechanics are good. But I don't like the fact you can only buy characters with the in-game currency. Would think it would be better if there was more stuff to buy. E.g weapons. Hats. Gun skins, character skins.
Nathan Norwood : I love this game! It's funny, fun and competitive. I also love the animations.Easy to learn controls but hard to master.
Fizzy Fox : Amazing, original too I have never seen anything like this! Um,I like the goofy movement when they jump,and how they talk can you add it where you can walk? Just a bit sometimes you can get far away from your enemy.
Ethan S. : The gameplay is good and fun, but the menus are so glitchy and most of the time get messed up, making me exit the game then come back.
Matt Edie : Great game! Great graphics and game play. Had an issue with previous purchase after I reset my device, and the dev was quick to respond and resolve the issue.
Tyler Habwe : One of the best duel games on the app store it's super funny the way the bullets bounce off of you. And the super skillshot it would be cool if you can get a dope skin
Jonathan Nava [Johnmaster21] XD : Very awesome game! I actually first had my doubts about this game. Later, as I kept playing I hooked on. Nice graphics and pretty funny gameplay. Although they could have added a multiplayer showdown like "Bowmasters" but it gets it's five stars 👍
Daniel Burt : Incredible. I never review games, but this one is totally unique. The sound design and soundtrack alone are worth it! And the game is tons of fun.
Abdulaziz : amazing game but it has a bug: when two people fall at the same time the "Refill medkit to duel with full health bar" option doesn't appear. Please fix it
Chris Runyon : Came back to see if you had fixed any issues.. but nope game still sucks!
Luciano Musella : Excellent gameplay and polish, the only issue is that it's P2W, not by a lot, but it is unfortunately. Still fun for a couple of matches with the fake players.
Anindya Sur : Great game, some save flaws. Got to level 3 and then the game did a full wipe sending me back to the the start screen. Is there a way to bring back my progress?
Visalam M : Honestly, this game is so Underrated. It's Funny, it's good. The Characters, Soundtracks it's all Pure Fun. Compact Size, Online Game. Graphics is Cartoony, and Entertaining. Very Unique Game with its own Territory.
Abhijit Mhasagar : The opponent kill me only in 2shot even after i hit him 5 shots still he was standing
Ant Corona : This game is not ONLINE reason 1 you can pause the game in online games you can't pause online games second reason ads in middle of fights online games can't have that and third reason: unranked people having new skins and other guns and things that you need levels for and yes I know you can buy them but them having rare skins are obviously bots
oompa loompa : Others than the somewhat kinda glitchy physics (it only glitches sometimes and very rarely and it won't shoot sometimes but that might just be my phone) it's a really good game.
jeffery van williams : extremely well executed. higher than normal quality production. ingenuity : 8/10 polish: 7/10 physics: 9/10 adfckery annoyance: 3/10 (10 being most annoying) worth trying , if only because I actually was pretty good at this from match number 1, so , maybe I'll see ya in the game, pardner...🤠 this is a fun game. not too ad annoying . DC heavy & for real cash, Daddio... careful!
Eric Walker : Very fun game and very addicting. A lot of people complain about having to watch ads, which are short and not very frequent. The makers of this game need to make a living and the game is well worth a few short ads here and there. You are not entitled to free entertainment, so suck it up and have fun.
Kanaga Selvi : This game is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo amazing and the graphics are sooooo good I highly recommend this game but I already have found a glitch when both the player dies in offline mode I win and in the next round a glitch strucked the game and I dide when I spawn and in ultra graphics on searching players is down a little bit...
Nash Bates : Game dont work, always crashes, cant have a opinion
Daniel Shatters : It's pretty fun an the characters sounds awesome and the movement when you get shot an stuff is cool. Massive amount of guns and characters. The two I liked the best were good star wars character from attack of clones, and Cthulhu. 🥇
Ynut Lopez : Its a really good game but they should maybe add a story mode and maybe upgrade weopons and some taunts like and different maps like day time,Night time, and maybe some ablities you could use Thats all I have to say i really like this game.
Fett_collects19 : Such a simple and fun game! Love the style and how you can just easily play short matches whenever you have any spare time on your hands! Excellent!
Gagan Basra : I wrote a review before but I said something wrong it's not the gunslinger challenge it was the super skillshot challenge so all i got from this challenge was 100 gold it says you get something awesome but all I got was 100 gold. I don't know if this is a bug or not please reply and if it's not a bug you guys really need to fix the prize it was not worth my time I did the challenge twice to see but I only got 100 gold the first time and the second I got nothing
Devin Venne : It's a pretty fun game at first. But the more I play the more my bullets somehow go straight through enemies without doing damage. A wonky mechanic tbh.
Unicycle Boi : I somewhat liked this game but the thing that annoys me is it says it os multiplayer yet the tags for the game are offline and singleplayer. I read responses from devs about multiplayer and they say it is supposed to be a ghost of the player with the same skill level. This would require a advanced self-learning ai and it is practically impossible to measure the skill level in this game. I hate when these games try to make you think your playing multiplyr. Just admit to having normal ai's
アルプ : I bought the pro version. Everything is cool but phone runs slow on skillshots. Please fix this. My graphic settings are low. Thank you for response.
adnan hammoud : Its simplicity makes it very engaging and addictive. I wish I can play against friends though I'm not sure if you can or if its something I need to unlock. Great game!
Gavin Peterson : This game is trash. No health regen between rounds and it costs 100 to refill your health? And winning the tournament only gives you 150? No matter how good or fast you are you're going to take damage at least a few of the rounds meaning you have to grind out a few stars at a time unless you want to pay them real money to actually have a fair shot at winning. What a scam. I can't believe this game is rated as high as it is, it's a cash grab.
Y75R : This is one of the best games ever!!! I have played for just 3 days and its so captivating! Its silly and fun, i hope there will be many more updates, and can people give ideas for new gums? It could be a great way to implement fan made things in game!
Iman Dashto : I love the game but the one where you shoot the can in the air 3 times is impossible If you shoot it two or one time it flys away in to the distance so to make that not happen add a wall to prevent it not to happen 😀
Cheese : This game is a lot of fun and was a great surprise. I do wish once the level timer began I wasn't forced to abandon the remaining stars unless I played a lot then.
Skin and Bones : I love this game and it is simple. If you are the person that plays simple games you have to get this one! All I think the developers should do is make the bosses a little easier. Great game
Emanuel Mason : So funny. A bunch of current references makes it amusing to find them.
Michael Wilber : Really fun to play. Definitely two thumbs up
Wesley Stewart : Incredible graphics and humor! Crossbow sux tho.
shane tobin : It's good game quite hard at times. I gave 4* because I dont believe it's actually online players u play all time think its computer also having to pay for designer guns unless u win just normal ones. Not many ads to.
Xillo : This game is fun, the gunplay is snappy and it has a fun visual style. But your multiplayer is absolutely fake. You aren't fooling me, not once do you ever fight a human opponent.
CS16 : This game is amazing it really has improved the controlls are kinda the same and everything else has improved so much! But the only problem is the AI's can get overpowered guns that are one tap to the head Overall this game is cool🙆
Yrsa Loðbrók : Fun game. Minimal advertising.
A Google user : The game is perfect 👌 but it does need a dit improvement like some time it lags a lot the developer does need to fix it. but I'm level two so what do i know.
Jonah Warren : The gameplay is great but not being able to return to levels and complete the trophies makes the game completely unplayable for me.
Sam Yeates : Really fun, simple game. Despite simple premise, lots of play time. Free version is very playable, ads are not too frequent. I got the pro version because I enjoyed it so much!
Vishesh Saxena : Nice game, quite addictive, creative, but it get laggy a time , I don't why ,may be bcz of server, and few areas are quite biased to opponents especially the cliff one , try to fix them ...
magolore : The game is very good but I keep experiencing a bug. Mostly every single time I play the game it just crashes. Please fix this.
Ruzantsu : This game opens and loads but then it's a blank screen for a long time and I keep rebooting it till it miraculously works. I hate having to do it everytime.(from my oneplus 6)
FILIMON ALVAREZ : This game is amazing! Good quality, easy controls and realy run to play. Something i do wish though is a multiplayer mode and friends so i can add poeple. Also can u guys add a online mode?
Dustin Zhang : Watching ads, but no golds rewards from mission.
Sushila Adhikari : This is gumazing game it is a good time passer even the bots act like real humans so it is challenging many people say that it is bad that you need money to heal just go and win some matches and it will be super easy you need to heal a lot because you are not good but you can win also. Like other games it does not force you to pay it is optional and you know even the developers need money Anyway very good game
mike cheetham : Great game I'm really enjoying it love the graphics and the game play
Weldon Braud : The physics aren't perfect and where the gummuys are placed on the field isn't always fair, but that also adds to the entertainment at times.
Mali : Despite being called, "gunslinger," it's actually no that violent, and very fun! One small glitch, I can sometime glitch out of the room/level and I have to reboot the game. Plz fix
Kafka Frate : Really fun game and fast to play. But you have to aim for the head if you wanna eliminate faster your opponent. The jelly makes it even more fun :)
Hanz Louie Upao : There are no endless and multiplayer mode Only death Match , if you die revive ,. It needs to update now to be easy mode hard, medium and impossible mode to play and with bonus. To play it need to now name To play.......
Francisci Guardado : I like this game a lot but the thing I hate the most is the falling off the map and you can't dodge the bullets so it a two star and i hate that you cant buy guns with the coins you earn in the game😡
Grant Garcelon : Its nice to see a game where there was obviously a lot of effort that went into making it. Play this game instead of those trash games that all use the same engine, spam you with ads and take a weekend for the devs to make.
Milan Patel : This game is very fun to play. I enjoy it but you could add the movement or maybe just add the jump and duck button which will improve the overall gameplay.
SpookiBatGaming : There are a ton of levels that start you right against the edge of the map but your opponent is no where near it so it's an easy with for them.
Isaac Skinner : A beautiful game! The physics look so good, and the graphics are kept simple. It's not pay to play, it requires actual skill, and is addicting. 10/10
Isaiah - : You have to watch ads in order to play with guns you unlock. I like the game, but cmon really? All that time I put into trying to unlock some stuff only to be told I have to watch ads or purchase "pro" to use them.
Jakub Juchum : Haven't got too far, but it's a nice distraction. The only thing - on level 1 there was an hourglass and I was supposed to finish within 2 hours. I did and nothing happened. No idea what was that about :-P
Noah Reaves : Freaking pissed off, can even tap to shoot, all I can do is aim and die...not to mention my BOT opponent had a racial named slur!
Mochammad Rachka : Please, make some real challenging. I mean, player v player (Realtime-Online). Trust me, if this thing you (itatake) work on it, lt will be more interesting. I'll be invite much friend to play this game. Overall, not bad, good work. G'luck! I'll be waiting for it.
Daniel Huertas : It is truly a complete shame as great as this game is the software makers cannot make levels fast enough. The game loses complete interest when you're playing most tournaments against AI.
Taichi Favio Yoshida Inoue : The game is so fun and simple. You can keep playing this game week after week and never get boring. Just one thing i would like that the team can improve is that you can play with your friend or make your own tournament to play with they.
Aaron Gering : I absolutely love this game. Had to remove ads for a small fee but worth it. Dig the graphics and easy to use interface. I recommend it.
tr4shpanda : It's really fun and for a mobile game it is well put but there are a few downs like it shows zero health but there still alive but that's really it its really addictive and fun you should try it out :) barely any ads no pay to win just clean fun needs a 5.0 love it and enjoy it soooo much :) :) :) :) :)
Jaxon : With a cast of quirky characters and hilarious Clint Eastwood-esque duels, Gumslinger has to be one of the best PvP(b) games out there. I strongly recommend this game for a test of muscle memory, speed, and accuracy.
Kafka Emon : Fun Gameplay and Addictive. But very high price to go pro and there is no cheaper ad removal (only) option. And except Revolver & Shotgun most of the guns are less interesting or boring.
L.A. C : I don't understand why this app robbed me of over 1800 credits or (what ever they're called) after buying 1 new gum slinger which only costs 400. Now all of my money is gone. It took everything for one stupid purchase. I liked this game until this
RileyOregon812 : Take out the levels where you come out of nowhere they're so dB. The skeet shooting is also annoying when going for the trophy.
anastasia bethell : It is technically like rdr but in gum version .Rdr was my favorite game during my childhood ,I remember it like was yesterday, when I was 6 years old, I got rdr on my ps3,I was so excited!I would wake up 7.00 am in the morning just to play rdr on my ps3!☺Oh the memories I had were amazing!
Harshil Modi : Good game!! 3 stars because for free to play players have to watch that ** ad before entering the tournament. And that "gun slinger" screen takes more time to load than it should be. Else it deserves 4-5 stars.
KeyKay3200 : The game is kinda cool but why do I keep losing every round and also I need to explain Why is the shotgun weak and why is the crossbow really weak this game 1 star I hate it.Please do not install the game it is trash. The creator must add a weapon upgrader
Laura Stoner : This game is frickin awesome! my goals were to deafeat lobster Bob and get the shotgun and I did it! This game is so fun hope to see more updates in the future..............ps I ta take debuff the shotgun it's to overpowered!
Jonathan Woodcock : This is tied for my favorite game of here right now it's not p2w and it's fun the controls are ready and the physics are pretty spot on for what's going on in there the only other game that goes a candle to this is guns at dawn
Lucas Lanctot : Lol imagine charging for things in a game that literally doesn't work. Bullets go through people. You only play AI. Terrible terrible trash game. Save the time. Don't bother with this useless garbage
AJ : Fun game but why the fake multiplayer? If you play with internet the names change from having AI in them but they're still very obviously AI. The only reason I can see for having internet in the "online" match is so that you could get the ads Edit from 3 stars to 2: you lie in the description about it being online
JoJonoMuskets : Quite a fun, physics-based experience, though it is grindy. Great fun if you prefer skill and tire of those P2W games.
Guillaume Fontan : Very well made, not too many ads
Neal Kaplan : Deceptively addicting. Didn't know I'd get so sucked into this. I think it's the fact that the quick tourny style duels gets the competitive juices flowing so that it gives you a steady dopamine drip of cartoon style gun pleasure. Don't know what if that makes any sense but i highly approve of this game. Simply a joy to play
Pizza Crust : this is the most fun game I've played that's got guns cartoony graphics and all(I don't play fortnite that's why) I'm amazed :) this game is so well made i now have alot of the characters im trying to get venus flytrap...but i would love if the gun skins didnt cost money because i vant afford them and they look cool, thank you
scrapy yt : (Real person)Great game it has wacky and fun mechanics but the reason for 4 stars is it always puts the same advertisement for some pro pack. I forgot what it was called but overall it's a pretty good game. One day I would like to make a game like this.
Cherish Sita Ayu : The character are cute and this is a good game. Thanks
pablo Lopez : I like the game but one thing that they could fix is earning the gun skins and not have to buy them. $0.99 is a good price but still it would be a lot better if you could earn the gun skins and not have to buy them. Soo thats why I rate this game a four star rating.
Josephandshea Crull : It is a fun game that you can play with at her people and have a lot of fun with
Neil Conde : Great game defently needs more respect love the gummys just make the splatters for coins
KIVANÇ TEK : It is so good sometimes but mostly it is the worst game İ have ever seen. It says you are playing with other played but you are not. Also, it want you to watch a video for play with other guns. You can just use one gun without watching a video.
Maria Fernandez : It was great I liked it very much and can't wait for updates keep it going😃👍
Gaspachio Donatelli : Super fun progression, and I love how you really need skill to win instead of pay to win like most app games. I just wish you could add more personality without paying like adding unique color schemes or co cop missions for friends.
jayden james : This game is very engaging,I downloaded and played this game for a fun ragdollish game,meanwhile it's a very engaging and quite frankly stupid game,it's controls are horrible,and if you can never win,I literally can't even win my 1st tournament,it's too hard,and it's annoying.
Hollis Laskey : love the game, my only grievance is that in order to use guns other than the basic one, you have to either watch ads to fill them with ammo temporarily or purchase the "pro" version of the game.
Sudip kr. Dey : Its nice concept and fun to play.....i also buy the offer but there is a problem in a specific match where the health is can't restored it said that have yo pay 100 so to refill it and another thing is that the opponent has a more powerful gun than me which cause to me for defeat......
Christopher Storm : Game can be frustrating at times. Shoot an Opponent 5 times including headshots, but he shoots you once and he wins. Needs work.
Ben Sotheran : Its just fun.Good ti pass time and cure boredom.
Rachel Verburg : A great great game. One think I'd like for the future is being able to play against or with yoyr friends.
Ayushmaan's Earth : Amazing game its actually a shooting game I like there are many reasons why it's my favorite well first of all it isn't a pay to win well I guess it isn't 100% pay to win because characters do have different traits and also this game has put this satisfying feeling whenever I win I have a very good feeling cuz I clutched and beat them, no game has ever been able to bring that out of me since 2017 and there are many other reasons why it's a good game but no space to write them so I recommend
Lisa Walsh : Love this game! Graphics are kinda goofy but well done at the same time. Game play is accurate and really entertaining, would definitely recommend this game to anyone, any age. Nice job folks. I look forward to seeing more game's from you.
Jason McLane : It increases my heart rate. Lots of fun. And after 2 weeks, I'm still playing & enjoying it. It is a challenge. 👉 It's been 7 months since I began playing and it is still lots of fun. I highly recommend this to anyone.
Luca_ Dovekendall : For stuck in lockdown and most phone games played I have been endlessly looking for something to play and this popped up. At first I thought it was a one time thing but really it's the best game for lockdown. signed prefectpizza
Prithvi Krishnan : Pretty fun game, even though the sole purpose is to only duel, the game doesn't even get boring... What I feel should be improved is that the FPS because it drops so much that quick drawing becomes a bit difficult, and the bots should be more stronger too...
Damindu Dilsara Hettiarachchi : I've been searching the whole store for a fun, time killer and this was epic for that. Amazing graphics and easy controlls. One of my favourites so far.
Michael Dean Popp : loved the game, would have gotten 4 stars do to the fact its kinda the same thing over and over but it lost the second star when it introduced the crossbow, they seriously screwed the pooch on this one. it doesn't fire the same distance everything there is no rime or reason to it just dumb.
John Natale : Great Game that's actually free to play and doesn't bombard you with adds. Really smooth and easy controls. I love it.
chrisjoe015 : Love the game. Fun characters and vivid colors bringing the game to life. Very addicting with challenges to pass and daily reward to receive.
Sidharth : Not able to choose guns...No matter how many times i tap on shotgun it reverts back to revolver in every other game..Give an option to tick and choose the gun just like we can choose the gumslinger
MrStormX : Good game but it got bored easily... I hope you can add multiplayer mode with different modes in it... And i very recommend this game has a battle royale cause that will make the game more awesome and fun. Btw i really satisfied with the creative characters... Good job 👍👏👏👏
Silas : The controls are simple and fun, the graphics style is awesome, the game is fun and has a neat level up system that makes sure you never get bored
Nosacrality : Would be fun if it were actually online. You gave AI names that real people would choose, and you even put the name "N****R". You can sit for hours, and your opponent will never draw their gun before you. They only draw the second you put your finger on the screen, like it knew you even placed it there before you moved
Jason Ortiz : Fun game challenging players and challenges. I like it good pass time game. Graphics are good and controls are simple.
Sherif ElNayad : This game is just awesome , love the idea and it is executed perfectly , ads arent many , i would love to see more customization like changing colors of gumslinger , adding accessories etc
Rafy : I love this game is so fun but me and my friends would really appreciate a online multiplier system so me and my friends can play together for example me can friend each other with a friend code and play matches against each other other tha that this game is really good one of the best phone apps and I have purchased Pro and do not regret thank you for this game!!
DEON Eisara williams : The game is really good but when I'm playing it it doesn't it make me want your ads every time and I don't like it but I die when the ads over
KingSveniboy : Absolutely love it, it's a great time waster, the graphics are dope and the gameplay is just outstanding. Keep up the good work!
Harsh Rajpurohit : Love the ragdoll physics and occasional jump that the character do to reduce the distance between the opponent. Really a game worth playing! ❤️🔥
Rihana Boos : Fun but the controls dont work well at all
Brandon Bushell : One of the best games I have ever played for multiple reasons. Very few ads, lots of content and a very fun art style. One of the very few gems in the play store.
Steve Gentry : Enjoy it... Okay, I stopped playing for a while, re-installed on a different phone, and for whatever reason, I cannot log in on Google Play, so all my purchases, progress, etc... IS GONE?!? Surely you have a contingency for this, eh? You'll get your stars back, when I get my time back...
Pineapple Gaming : I love it. It's basically gummies that shoot guns. It's pretty child friendly as it doesn't have violence other than a gun. 5/5 amazing game. I've tried so many games and this one is honestly fun and enjoyable
faridah daud : This game is awesome!!!!!pretty hard to control but thats fine!!!graphics also awesome!!!i won my fist tournament and it encouraged me to continue the journey.i also searching this game the whole noght because i forgot the title.and i find this game.this game is cool really recommended to everyone!!!!!
A Gleason : Good game but maps are a little not fair at times. Also being able to shoot more times then you should on the ground gets annoying.
Gamer208 playz : It's so hard the second level for level 1 is so hard becuase of the last part of it becuase you got to get 3 stars on the last one and you cant do that inless you can hit all the bottles that they throw at you dont get it
Caleb Holliday : It seemed like a fun game but the flinging and jumping is to difficult to aim. And when you jump over things you tend to fall over and they absolutely decimate you.
William Teeter : Fun, a few adds but otherwise near perfect
FaerHazar : Its really great. Its got some good visual humor and is fun to play, but its a little slow, progress wise.
Father Stick : Fun, addictive, easy to play, and win. Fast paced, challenging, well put together, fun and loveable, cruel and punishing. This game is a blast to play, and looks even better.
TDeepWeb : Some maps are based on lucks but not pure skills. You either got fling away or fell down the map without getting hit! Btw, i love ragdoll game but im giving it 1 stars since it is giving me triggers instead of comedy even though it is a ragdoll game.
thePlopper : I really like this game. I like how each character is special and not just a cosmetic. One idea, please add more updates to the pass to make it more valuable. I'd like to see what you guys will do to the game in the future. (:
Robbie Hall : I enjoyed it at first, but eventually the balancing issues killed it for me. Don't even try to tell me that a grenade launcher that can one-shot kill is balanced. 4 stars if you fix this.
Gabriel : I don't know why, but this game is so fun i can't believe it, maybe I'm crazy. And if feels so innocent shooting gumballs with real weapons it's not even real. Please add more character customization options.
Michael : Good job keep it up. I think you should shorten the ranks because it is really hard to get there. I think maybe a little shorter or maybe you should add that we can buy guns instead of waiting. Thank you for the feedback.
Smord : Great game. Clever system: you fight against AI but the "Gumslingers" you fight against are owned by players. So it is PvP but you'll never have the problem of not being able to get into duels. Your Slingers earn you in-game currency by fighting even when you're not playing yourself. Easy to play, very funny and quite addictive. 5*
spoodermn 21 : Very very fun. I have some frame drops sometimes but I can deal with it. No pay to win elements or microtransactions shoved in your face. Very good job.
Robert Ferris : Very fun competitive gun battle game. Easy controls and few ads. Like to turn up the volume to hear guns roar. Highly recomend.
pop tarts : Really fun and a good game to play if you need t wait for something
Zander morris : This game is a lot of fun. I quite enjoy playing it, but there is one small thing I find annoying. I wish you could earn weapon skins from stars, and not have to to pay a dollar for each weapon skin. Other than that, nice job Devs.
Jonathan Spence : I hate that you gotta pay for 'medkits', which if you don't have, its impossible to get further than the second or so stage. Uninstalled. Edit: XD And you get a whole two coins with each win? Suuuure, lemme just do 50 rounds and eventually get one medkit
x29DOOMsday : This is a great game i love the diifferent challenges and weapons espeicaly the shotgun. Things i want to see added are snipers rocket launchers 2v2 game modes. Overall its a great free game with across the world tournaments great skins. Great game u guys did a great job with this amazing game
Kelsie Plumb : This is the best game I've ever seen im at the point where I got a free wood skin for my guns ty so much guys it means a lot
Jovis Joseph : Really fun idea. But once you realise that you are playing with bots the fun just goes away. They say it's PvPb (I guess it's player vs player bots). I've never heard of such an abbreviation even I searched in internet and found nothing. I think they are trying to decieve us by using a similar abbreviation to PvP. If it was a real PvP it would have been a great game.. but its a good game to play once thou even if you are playing with bots
certified b r u h : It's a fun game but the reason I rate it 1 is because I bought the pro version and gold and ray skins then all my progress rested. I was scammed out of my money, if this was a glitch please fix it. I want a refund or give me the stuff I payed for, thank you.
Aleksandar Komazec : It is a great idea, but i gave you 1 beacuse you scam people showing layout " finding opponents". This is not an online game, and there is even no match making. This is just a single player game with bots, but wrapped as a multi player. Stop scamming people and you will get 5 stars. Five stars, I have assured in you words. Go ahead 🙋‍♂️❤️
Fernando Tafoya : I really liked this game it dose not have much ads
TinybigEyese : These are some really fun gummy gum jelly gumslingers The game runs very bad though
Vale Tattoo : One of the best games I've played on the phone. 4 stars because there is no store in game to buy cosmetic things from points earned by playing. If you want skin, you have to pay money..
Mohammad Najm : Hilarious game which is well made and fun to play! The simplicity of the game is the main catching point and the hilarious music is just a plus
Dave Gschwind : Newest update does fix the framerate issue, stabilized into a playable framerate, 20-30ish. Still takes some time to reach 120 fps. Thanks devs! Keep it up
Nickolas Martinez : Great time killer, simple dueling game play with extra game modes throughout levels and tons of cosmetics with semi fair pricing. Overall surprisingly fun.
James Whitelock : Graphics are very good 👍
Eben Beukes : This game is sooooooo addictive and fun!! A game I always wanted. If there is one thing that would make this game epic would be a slow motion replay or slowmo mode. But otherwise this game is awesome!
Cyrus Lee : Cool guns, cool skins I like it because it has cool guns
BadROBTHEBOSS : Love this game. Barely any ads, lots of fun gameplay, I think the skillshots are a little difficult but after some attempts I can pass them
ørpz is wierd : This game is pretty fun but the only reason I'm giving it a 1 star review is because I bought the pro starter pack and got NOTHING absolutely nothing and you can't even refund it
Narene Stevens : It is a amazing to play this game and no pay to win it is the best game to get because it is not pay to win
Luke Johnston : Fun but too many ads for things
Connor Munro : I like the game but it switching me to the revolver if I'm on a different gun.
Frank Bell : Originally gave this game five stars until one day I opened it and I was back to level one with a laggy game that couldn't even be played.
David Smiley : Very cool but us 1 handed desparados cant play... can i get a 1 handed mode?
Rocky Gonzalez : Good game play. However, I only got to play for a while due to the really raunchy add that popped up. I was offended I had to uninstall the game quick! Looks like some type of sex trafficking going on. Someone should check on that.
bud ani : Fantastic game you can play for free, no pay wall to progress.. this is how games should be glad to see the developers keeping it old-school and not forcing in app purchases to progress through the game.. played for 4 days before I chose to support these awesome developers!!
Adarsh Singh Gautam : Gameplay is very addictive and fun but main UI is little bit confusing like how to continue further in game. Would like to see a update for that. Cheers.
Mack Fruck : My bullets go threw the opponent. Arrows go right threw. Stats are nothing when it's rigged. Really guys ?
mark rush : its ok...seems so random tho who wins the duels...you dont ever seem to increase you skills because you can be shot dead in an instant or you might win a tournament...its random either way it seems.
Capalot Kelley : It's It's very badly designed game. It's legit so frustrating
Ivans Electrical Maintenance Tips : Its nice but i have a problem where when i shoot an object directly in the middle, i miss. If you fix this problem, i will give 5 stars
Jeremiah Shewcraft : Fun, quirky, and short game sessions make this a plus in my book. Plenty of unlockables and replay value. Overall, recommended.
Kendo Hanlon : It's so good the graphics are briliant
Damien Smith : Good time killer if ure waiting to clock into work or just casually gaming
Murdoch Ruffin : I recommend this game because it challenges you and you can battle others
Ningthoujam Chandikumar : I rate it one star because i didn,d get stars in level 4
the gaming cook : Bots don't die, takes about 10 shots to kill them, it's awful
Gabe perez : It's really fun. The physics are goofy and amusing. The leveling is challenging but it's not pay to win which is always amazing.
General Yosif : It's still bad, I am sorry. This has a potential to be something bigger and not a mobile game. Also, it didn't give me my little progress I had when I signed in with Google again and this is veeeery bad. Imagine I had a lot of progress, change my phone, install the game back on it only to realize I haven't even finished the tutorial. The game just isn't good in general. It is just pointing and shooting. It needs more. That is why I said it can become something big.
Travengamer : I think the controls are way too hard and it was lagging 50 percent of the time. I also hate it when one of the characters is behind cover and you are right in the open
Matthew Foss : It's really fun. It would be cool if there was a replay after each match, like a slowmo killshot or something.
michael glicas : I love this game. The physics are really cool and the gummy body of your character is bouncy and funny. I think it has improved since the last reviews I've read. Its fun now and I'm really good at it.
Devam Bansal : Great game. Could be more fun if they added walking, manual jumping and long range fights. Maybe with fully player aspects.
A Google user : Nice game to kill time and not work to hard
Max Merra : Its a good game, But its really dumb that you keep your health from the last match amd then get the option to regen it with coins. Its pay to win and thats really annoying.
Jack Cartee : Perfect Old West meets Candyland shooter. Also doesn't bombard you with ads. And you can rank up without paying a fortune, because skill matters. 😎🤙
wajee gaming : That's a pretty decent game nice graphics and all
Mr. Monkey : This game is garbage. When you get closer to level 2 in it your no longer able to fire your gun. It's a waste of space and should not be on the playstore.
Felix Kim : Sucks. It is almost impossible to beat the EASIEST LEVEL how am I suppose to have fun with this if I lose every single time!? This game is ridiculous and whoever the creater was did a terrible job on adjusting the level difficulty.
Loch Nessie9 : Overall, I enjoy the app and it is an easy way to kill a few moments in between doing things. It's fun and visually nice to look at.
Kayla Williams : It's so good cuz you get to customize as much as you want to collect daily awards and they look really cute and you can upgrade your characters you should download it to I think you have a better time
Michael Strantzalis : Great idea, nice mechanics and beautiful graphics. And most importantly, few and non intrusive ads! Great job! Keep up ;)
Just A Lemon : Love it and i would like to give u some new ideas such as making it a Lan-Game (Or Offline Multipkayer Game) where they can battle each other or make a coop version where both of them are surrounded by gumbies (zombies) =) , Thank you for responding =)
Zachary Desaine : The game was quite fun from my perspective,the ragdoll effects and action with the maps but i do wish there was a bigger range of weapons to use.
Hell lord : Pay to win app the med are too expensive. And the way some map are designed are unfair. And half the time when you knock someone out they are are knocked out forever. And they can shoot when knocked out it's hard while shoot them while they are knocked down because of the shrink in size.
Brandon Carman : Great game, but there has been a couple times where I quick draw someone in the head, and it does no damage at all. I'm only experiencing this with the shotgun.
Jaiden Keene : Good game. Broke after a while. Uninstalled reinstalled and lost some progress. However I did lose my pro so a restore purchases option would be cool.
Andries Esterhuizen : This game is pretty simple on the surface, but the amount of small details and the physics makes this game so much fun. Really great job team, something to be extremely proud of!
Rule Britannia : Wouldn't even open. I tried tons of times, with the internet on and off. It just froze the second it began, crashing my whole phone.
Dark Link 64 : Good time killer, and a good game all around. A gummy version of Red Dead Redemption, but only the quickdraw parts.
Andrew Ritfeld : Fun game with great visuals. Wish it had a replay option so I could rewatch the duels in slow mo and different angles.
Martyn Daines : Idea for the game is good. But having to spend credits to heal between tournament duels leaves you at a serious disadvantage. After just 10 minutes you know only people who pour money into this game will benefit, so uninstalled.
Z Bug : Ok so i have two suggestions 1. Lower the price on the health kit i would say $15 2. Have the option to play offline. And another thing evey singel time at the end of the tournament no matter where you hit them they will never die.
Rush E : Good game, but I could already tell this game was like all the others when I saw pay for full hp. I shouldn't need to pay for full hp in any game. That would give my opponent who didn't get hit a single time a advantage.
Rory Platt : So far, great game! $1.99 is a great price to pay for Pro and to lose the ads. Good fun for a quick timewaster.
Ameer Saib : This game is awesome, it's loads of fun to play, I could almost say it is addictive. I hope in future updates we will be able to have shootouts with specific friends.
Kyle king : It's challenging and fun but the super skills shots are dumb 1% people finished it more like none since the can flys off the screen after the second shot
Ayush Sarkar : Amazing tactical shooter game with mind blowing graphics and wobbly body ragdoll physics.Moreover the gameplay is very addictive with tons of guns and characters to play with.It runs very smoothly in my six months purchased Redmi Note 7 Pro which is an awesome mobile phone.Deserves 5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟, nothing less than that.Love it💖💖💖💖💖💖.
bill the first : i loved it and ive got an idea for a new game mode. perhaps you could have the two duelists given the ability to duck behind some kind of desrructable cover instead of just stand out in the open.#notabot
Sam Jones : Update 6/27/2020 - Different guns are free to use! My only complaint has been fixed! This game is a ton of fun, but I would recommend this game just on the fact that the developers are so responsive. This game will only improve!
Michael Mikhalchuk : Super fun casual 1 v 1 game with cool characters and challenges, amazing physics but too intense for my moto z4, slows down to a crawl when lots of things happening.
Amy Dyer : My kid loved this game... Until it stopped working. We uninstalled it, but he recently wanted to play again. We downloaded it and it will not even open. Every time he clicks on it, it pops up that it has to close.
ExoticcLegend : I like the overall feel of the game, but I find it hard to believe the 64 man online tournament isn't filled with bots, I just can't see how with only 5 million downloads that it finds 64 people so fast, is there a way to search for a 1 v 1
Casey Pape : This is a great time filler game. Leveling up and unlocking new characters keeps the game fresh enough to continue coming back.
Care L Bear : I am SO addicted to the game, I had it on my laptop but now on phone. I really didn't care my progress wasn't stored, ONLY way I'd do a 5 star is bc I bought a different gun style this time & AGAIN NVR got it. Yes I want it but it just prevents me to buy more & I Soo would
Talha J : Too addictive, has a little bit of ads but that's okay for me. The music, however is awesome, gives you the western kind of vibes but with a gummy bear kind of twist. Really love it!
jon Tracey : So addicting. Love the simplicity. The graphics are super clean and the controls are very precise. Love this game
Nathan Winstanley : I give this a 4 stars because I got a new phone recently and this was the first game I installed and my progress wasn't saved even though I was logged into Google play and was very disappointed but apart from that it's a great game but I don't fancy starting all over again 😔
Kristi Marie Brackman : Amazing Game 11/10 So I was snooping around on my phone and seen this game I immediately pressed on the app and downloaded it im about to play it some more can't wait for more updates 😀 🙌 Edit:I have a note 10 and when I start that game its kinda laggy and slow I'm not sure if thats my wifi or what but it only does it on the first match so I'm giving 4 stars but when that is fixed ill give 5 stars
David Hardesty : NOT a money grabbing game I love that. Only had it for a couple weeks now and can't seem to find a reason to delete it. Grafics are great. It's definitely a keeper.
Josiah Stocker : This game is a lot of fun. I love the ragdoll mechanics and their weird nonsense speech is hilarious. And there's a bunch of levels so lots of content.
Al Horgan : Needs a seperate music and fx mute switch. I love this game, but I need to be able to hear the music/podcasts I want to hear and not sacrifice the sound effects.
shitty memes : It's broken like how does the ai have perfect 2 shot kill aim when I shoot then 5 times and they still live like it's not fun like I thought when first playing but oh no I lose twice and the ai just gets harder like that's just such bad game design
Joseph : Anyone else think it would be fun to view a replay of the duels??? Can that be done??? Maybe just give an option to save replay at the end of each battle, similar to the way you, refill your life before the next battle.
Hackviz : Very very very cuute game! It doesn't even has any violence. The controls are really good! Thanks for the developer for making such a great physics game😃👍👍
·[Teh Epik Duck]· : Challenge, fun, and cool! The gummies with guns are a cool idea! It makes the game look funny and silly. And the sound effects make my gameplay very fun. I'd suggest adding loot boxes to earn gun skins, gummies, or possibly a gun! Or maybe more challenges like a giant gummie boss, tiny gummies, or zombie gummies! Anyways, love the game!
victoriouswheel : This actually one of very few mobile games that has any sort of improvement or skill curve. It's really nice to feel like I improved after awhile.
Drew Fischer : Don't be fooled, it's not really online multiplayer; they don't do a very good job of hiding that. Despite this, though, it's still a charming little ragdoll game with fun gameplay and creative artwork
Matthew Swaim : Great game, but the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because when it says that you go against "real" players worldwide, you aren't. They are bots. It's a great game overall, but if they could just implement a multi-player system, I would rate it higher.
IGNITED fishy : Honestly, this game is perfect! Haven't had a full moment. The progression is fair, and there are no components that force pay to win gameplay.
iownagorillalamp : This game is one of the best games i've played by far. The controls are great and the softbody physics are glorious. Also this game has an actually good mobile ad instead of the horrendus ads that voodoo has been putting out
Final Flashman : So the game has the worst hit boxes, and you have to either WATCH ADS or PAY to use certain weapons, but it's fun when you first start.
DiSaSTeR 122 : I played for 2 days and then an update comes along and I go to play it and now it freezes on my galaxy S10 after the Title screen just sits on a blank biege page im outraged that I wasted my time getting good at this game just to not be able to play
Wade Nuthak : Congrats, Awesomeness in a game people,first there is very few ads,and the gameplay and physics are way cool and the sounds remind me of flubber the movie, keep it up
J Murph : Terriblely unbalanced, to make you pay. Game baits you into thinking it's balanced for the first 5 minutes. Than you have to pay to get health back every round in each tournament, making them impossible to win. The AI is extremely unbalanced and unfair. You dont pay against any actual players, its fake mutiplayer.
Mohosina Afrin Chowdhury Mishu : The game is good but it needs some improve ments.they should ad a joystick which can be used to control the character.If they get this the game will become 10 times better.
Zaza Onezashvili : This game is great in many ways while simple I truely suggest this game if you want too pass time while it has a cute art style and child like voicelines makes it far more family friendly while it is a wild west gun game they made it family friendly but still fun plenty of gameplay as well truely one of my favorite mobile games one Feng I suggest is too give more coins too whoever gets further into the tournaments and too make more of a skill gap this is my report too the Dev team hope it helps
Anthony Mora : This is honestly a good game in my opinion I haven't had this much fun at all. I would really love if this game had more skins or something like that and being able to unlock gun skins without paying but it's cool either way
Andrew Caris : Super funny game, love the physics. The game has intuitive controls and feels very fluid. The action is non stop gun blasting fun.
evil patrick : This game is so damn good...I like the style and the theme..It is not boring at all but i would like you to add friends and duels between friends. It would be awesome! I highly recommend this game to everyone, enjoy!
Jose De la rosa : This game is great the only way to make the game better in my opinion is to make it so you can unlock gun skins without waisting money I know you have to make money some how but as a 10 year old my mom won't spend money on phone games for me so can you make it so that you can unlock gun skins for free but pass that asside this game is great overall
Deadpool1526 : It's so fun I can't stop playing it's just 2 things thing1. Fight people thing2. Fight!! It would be cooler if you have a bot on your team and on the others team otherwise it's really fun thank you!
Mitchell Hall : It just seems to be a marketing scheme. They make it look like it is multiplayer and have you play fake bots that look like they bought extra things. If this game was actually multiplayer it would be amazing.
Isaiah_the_Rtard : Ok so the reason why i give this game 4 stars is because its a really good game its easy to get gummys and the guns look really cool but my problem is the levels...my most recent game my opponet was behind some crates while i was in plain site which in a way that was kinda unfair. But this game is great and if you see this game devs PLS add local multiplayer Pls😭
Nicolas Mrad : Lots of bugs in the game. Game keeps chosing revolver instead of shotgun. Everything should be paid for! Multi-player game is not even multi-player, not even online! Game has a nice idea but very poorly developed.
space abyss : I love this game, the gameplay it's very simple, graphics in this game doesn't matter, but they are also beautiful. I love the soundtrack, it's funny and beautiful at the same time. one of the most funniest games I have played this year, thank you. :)
General Person : Good game but, you have to pay money to actually use the other guns, i unlocked the shotgun, and i was forced to only use the revolver, because you have to pay to use other guns, why is this a thing? I would have given it 5 stars if this stupid decision of pay to use guns wasn't a thing. Until then, enjoy 2 stars.
Brock Goblin Lord : An incredible game that has a tycoon style, a shoot out style, and a collecting style, it was just like the add and had lots of things to do just making it that I wanted to keep going
Colton Craig : Extremely p2w with very little skill required. It is insane how p2w it is. You can buy health in the main mode to get an edge and you can buy characters that take less damage. Completely p2w.
Maxoryx : Enjoyed the game a lot, it is very well designed, works well, is very fun to play, addicted to it right away, recommending it to everyone, Developers! Keep working on this game it is awesome
Jayden Reyes : I recommend you to get this game! It's really fun I'm so glad this isn't I like the other games where there's to many ads. Again I recommend you to install this game! by the way it's just about playing with gummies :) And that's why this game deserves to get 5 stars
BARNSEY BOY : There is not much to say a bout this game.It is just awsome,it is fun and not easy or difficult,this is a very nice online game as u never lag or there are no bugs.Most importantly it doesn't have alot of ads.It is also a very nice game to get use to and keeps u entertained for a while.So recommended this game to everyone.Thank you for making this awsome game🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌
Epic Bright : Deleted my old review on accident, this is p2w because you can just buy coins and continously heal, ads are not that much of a problem for me, also different maps will just screw you over because of random things in the way, let us choose our maps, unless you make us pay for that.
Chris OQuin : This is a great way to kill some time... Intuitive controls, and a simple, fun premise.
Aaron The 3D Man : Best Game Ever! The Jelly Physics are amazing, I enjoy the fact that this is not a Pay2Win sort of game. This game will test your skill in timing and aim, as well as your understanding of physics! Love it!
Brian Pickavance : Not real multiplayer. Fun game for five minutes, but the real core of the game - dueling against opponents - is faked. Actually AI enemies. Disappointing.
Matthew Woolley : Great game, not complicated at all and the controls are easy to use. Great time killer while being a killer!!!
JustJase82 : Although the game is enjoyable and addictive, today I was faced with the sad fact that the vetting of names is sub standard. The "N" word was able to be taken as a player name, simply by spacing between each letter. Considering there may be children playing this game, but more importantly that it is just a disgusting word, I would have expected more of an effort in preventing this type of behaviour. Disappointed and appalled.
ito cool : Unique, Simple, and Addicting The in-game-purchase are fun to buy, but in the same time not a pay-to-win game, prices are reasonable too There's a bug after level 10 where the first random gun is always flintlock
I feel like Pablo : I've been beyond bored with mobile games recently and this game was a shining beacon of originality and fun for me. I don't usually do reviews but I just unlocked Jules Jackson as a gummy character and heard his victory taunt. I love this game so much lol.
Erich Knox : it's ok. the left handed shooting sets you up for failure and i am stuck at my current level and have been literally for months. it should not be that hard to advance, especially as i maxed out my gunfight stars.
llama hero : It's a fun game but th we te need to be cross hars cause you dont know your shooting and the trick shot when you press the reset button it restarts completely just do the levels that need replayed
Jordan Sangraw : Boring. The movement and game play isn't fluid. Solely single-player even when there's a multiplayer option.. it's just another players character controlled by AI.
Ethan Cline : This game is perfect! The only complaint I have is that there is no way to get the alternate gun skins without paying real money. If that changed, I would have no problems at all!
Joe Weisel : I love this game it's a good grind to soak up time. It's engaging and adorable. However I have 42 of 44 characters and it's saying I have them all and won't let me buy the last 2. Help?
Aram Badr : Love it ! Especially the wiggly clumsy soft body feel of the characters i wish the material had more jelly ( refraction ) feel to it , i also wish it had the option to play against other player not only bots .. keep up the good wigglly wiggle work 🍮 !
Anoosh Vicky : The game is awesome and iam addicted to this game, but it has some minor bugs which is quite irritating, only it works when i restart the game.
Heartc0re _ : It's super fun!! Never expected this kind of gameplay. Graphics are good too. Just having some frame rate issues on my oneplus5
RAGDOL GAMZOID : You know i play this game alot. And mostly i use this red gum dude in the game profile. But i just wonder how i get to pause in an online gameplay. I mean they don't give me "your network is disturbing" alert. Yeah some body explain that for me. What's different from the AI system
Legend of Zelda : It is a very unique game and surprisingly it doesn't get repetitive.You pass levels quickly,get new guns and skins and have fun.
NecromancerYT : Is a wonderful game full of fun physics,intense gameplay,and adorable characters, I do wish to see more games like this,pop up in the future!
Audrius Timleris : My expectations were low, but this game blew them right out of the water. It went above and beyond. Very funy interesting, yet a little bit wobbly mechanics, and overall interesting game
Sean Townsend : Solid gameplay loops. Just wish there was a way to unlock customization in game as opposed to outright paying for it.
Michael Isaksen : Honestly more fun that I thought is was going to be, but be warned the skill shooting parts may be a rage game for some! Haven't wanted to throw my phone this bad since flappy bird..
Franco Tarantino : Love it, love it, great time burner. Hate the shotgun. Hate paying for skins. Should be able to earn stuff easier. Its a game people - come on !!!
Mark Carter : I have only been playing a few days, but I am really enjoying it. Only thing that doesn't feel great is the levels where you can fall off a cliff. More luck involved there. Still enjoy the game!!
Cameron Johnson : Instantly hooked. This is a rare gem of a game. What may seem random and luck based is actually very skill based with a little bit of what i call "chaos management". No obvious p2w mechanics. Keep it up devs!!
Mark Cook : It's a simple concept, but done with great style and humour. Brilliant graphics fun little time waster. Still loving it 👍
Carolus Rex : I love this app. But there are is only one thing wrong with it. Sometimes bullets go through the top of the green bottle, and don't count as a hit. This got really frustrating.
Martin Smith : Fun game, not a lot of ads. If you want the cool effects and fun stuff you have to buy it no way to unlock it by playing the game
Mx : This game is extremely amazing. Low ads, perfect quality, the game play is so fun and hilarious, I play it nearly an hour a day, it is such a fun game to play. Definitely my favorite.
not glitch : This is the best mobile game ever! No ads, no pay to win, no lag all is fine! Also the characters sounds are so cute! This is indeed a cute game! I love this game! I recommend it.
Amiel Ray Villador : This game was fun but the problem here is that there is no option for the controls, the aim part is too high in sensitivity and there is no option to change it.
spike ware : This cute and mouth watering game stole my heart
Pierre Barbouche : Great fun in short bursts
Moose the goose : Stuck on level 23, don't know what to do with the sharks, instructions are unclear.

Tucker Boldi : Eventually the game gets impossible and make the ai faster than u, keep in mind u can only go so fast, and the ai has perfect aim I do not recommend playing the shogun levels
Brandon,s gaming and vlogs : Easily five stars. The music is great. If I want to show off my competitive side, this is the game, if it's not fortnite.
Erfan : Fake tournaments , its all AI. Look at the names , at the repetitive behaviour, reactions after winning, its not a guy, its computer.
Larry Luhrsen : Super fun everything's okay. I think they should put amended shotgun in it but I still love love it but you have to have a lot of patient

Natan Perlman : Great game. Amazing art style, hilarious visual humor, and perfect amount of challenge. Definitely recommend 👍🏻

Trey Eshenour : I love it but when you kill the opponent as they kill you, then you cant move or do anything the next round and you instantly die
Pac Dan : Oof I did it you guys can improve checkpoints for the BOSS level. Because it's super hard to kill him even at levels, 1 and 2

Tim Mc : Fun game. Would be great fun if I could play my friends rather than a random player online.

Don't Trip : How you gonna say that super skillshot is skillful when i have video evidence that my bullets are hitting the pizza but not destroying it, its like if its in front of it, thats not skillfull, thats bull
Trolling Flare : The only thing I hate is how you have to watch an ad to reload you gun except the first one I think that's really stupid
Thiva Delani : Health should be refilled after every match its not fair at all the opponent having full health and we having less we cant spend 200 to refill for every single match please fix this issue asap.thnx love the game though 👍
Barry Dillon : The game is fun but i dont lile the way u have to stay woth the same health each round it mskes the game to hard and that u jave to have to biy pro yo het the shotgun but the game is funny so you download

Kairo X : I love this so much, it's appealing, challenging, and the online service is wonderful. Thank you for making this. :)
Robert Yoho : I don't believe for a second these are real players. You expect me to believe 64 players finished their matches simultaneously? You think it's not suspicious that the opponent always has full health when you have to buy medkits? What a scam.
Alex W : I absolutely love this game, it became my favourite when the boss update got released, I also love the music, very funny, ads does not appear if I don't want to watch it for reward, Also the game is not p2w because you can only buy cosmetic items only pro gives you more rewards from star bar but that isn't a big advantage.
cain fields : Itake i love your games and all and when i saw the add i was excited to down load such a game but when i open it crashed i didnit twice it still crash so im sorry but its a no for me
Albert mendoza : i have 1 sentence to say..."this game is a masterpiece."
Brave Lion : I love the game, but i think the load your gun stuff and all the pro stuff is kinda cheap, if you guys removed that it would be 5 stars.

vernelia lowe : Its a great game but sometimes cheets come up like when we are on the edge and they aren't. But overall great game
Richard Beldad : Supppeeer addicting game ilove the graphics and the cute voices in the game but please can u add blood on in setting to make it perfect that all great jobbbbb guys!!!
Mohamed Moamen : It is very irritant that you can't turn off music except if you turn off the whole audio
Regnum defende : Love the game but there is no way those other players are not AI it's just obvious..why can't you make it actual PvP and give the players a to least some sense of achievement??..Sort it out..
Kyle : Fps drop even tho it is in low graphics,against ai,forcing to watch ads or pay to play with other guns definitely waste of time to download
Shawn McCready : It's fun quick turnover keeps moving it's got a slow game just wish I could interact with the other place as far as texting her communication
Solid Style : Best time killer... Should add more weapons and cut time for new level... 7 hours is too long.... But best game still
Ấu Dâm-san : Game is nice and all but if you guys can work out a local mutiplayer mode and add more mechanics to make the duel even more exciting then it would be awesome
Boi : Didnt really like it, graphics are okay, aiming is weird but simple, firing is okay, just didnt really like it
Fruitloop Eater : Would give full stars but me and my opponent died at the same time by falling off the map and I still won but next round I died right as it started because I had no health
Thy Godlike : I love this game so much it is funny and cool and the best part is the gummys so awesome and they SHOOT guns and that is a mix of cute but deadly gummys.
Pravin Gunjal : This game is really amazing by seeing the game size we thought it would be 2d game but I think this is a 3d game I love this game and the background sound it is so funny .😂😂
Shywisconsin : Good but ads Edit-The devs responded and I understand being a small team can be difficult if I can i would give 5 in a half stars manly because gameplay is very smooth and fun.
Pumpkin : Game is very fun and Controls are simple, but for big fingers hard to use.
Hurricane 415 : Just a cash grab. You have to buy medkits and then motivate you to buy coins. Cant even purchase skins with money. Don't download. Just a damn cash grab
gman cooler : Amazing gameplay but if you wanna have real fun you have to either watch a million. Ads or buy pro
Ets Sargent : Great game but please add a price on the guns so you can buy them with in game currency
da nu : the game is good qn grafics are great and for those who say lot of ads just turn the internet off
koolbatdude : I like it, but don't like the rage that I get when I play and miss every shot.
Kellan Sullivan : It was a fun game until the second level where they make you pay to use the very second thing you earn I'm never playing again
David Sanchez : I love the game. even tho it will cost you 1.99 to actually enjoy the game because of the ads but if u did buy pro its such a original and fun game 🔥🔥
Duane Shelton : It was fun until I came across people's screen names. Very ignorant to say the least. For example. The one name is BlackLivesDontMatter. The 2nd name is IKeelKneegars..... Now really. Get ahold of the situation. I like to have fun, but not with a bigot.
Travis Beard : Shot the enemy and knocked them behind cover. Couldn't shoot them but they could shoot me. No. Lame.
Anniana Jimenez : cool but this was suppose to be offline game not online and i am just losing because i don't have any coins and credit card! fix this into offline!
Karin Chalecki : There are many problems with this game there is 1 glitch that made me lose! THIS GAME IS TO HARD! Even the robots are to hard
Dustin Crawford : Great fun. I only wish things I already paid for and the level I was on would have carried over to my new phone.
jnhardenbrook : Playful, yet intense.
ProudGoat : The game is ok but I'm starting to get tired of all these games having cruddy fake online. The game is also insanely luck based and pay to win.
Marco Acosta : It was a great game and I love it. Its competitive, the animations are good, and for a mobile game, it isnt pay to win
Kaeden Schmoyer : I'm rating this 3 stars because the first round i lose half my health and I cant do anything about it so my opponent has more health and wins every time
Anacleto Montes : I enjoy playing it while I'm break time
Leo star : OMG, WHY ARE THE NPC'S HACKING? LITERALLY, THEY JUST DONT DO ANYTHING AND I DIE! THIS IS ILLIGAL (Reply: the game hates me so MAKE YOUR BOTZ EAZIER!!! @#$& )
joemsagum01 : I like it but does all guns skin need to buy to get and how do I unlock other guns thank you I love it very very much all graphic are great all as-in all all controls all ty bye
Terrell Bassett : I got this game thinking it would be fun.Loaded it and turned out to be both fun and addicting. Then just a few minutes ago I found out that my uncle helped make this game. I told him all about my experience and he laughed the whole time.
Tanvir Diraz : It says PvP in the description....but after playing for a while ...i actually understood my opponents were all bots...nothing else.... there's no online pvp feature. game was fun but fake information ruined it.
Dominick Bryant : I love all the modes it's just the way how other people die I'd like it if the last hit the gummy would get there limbs cut off or explode
Berfalia Jimenez : LOVE THIS GAME it's good I love how every gun does different damage also can you add a feature where you jump whenever you want like point the gun up :P
Stuart Smith : Good fun that is funny!
Arturs Rudzats : Fake multiplayer with toxic duels where enemies get to duck and jump to avoid bullets, you have to pay to refil HP and half of the bullets clip enemies anyway.
Wyatt Wilson : It is terabile after the 7 or 8 duel its impossible to do anything i have played day and night and i still cant level up dont get it its a waste of space
Chrissie 1905 : Cute unique game. Pretty easy to use. Overall not bad. Dont really have a complaint.

Justin Bateson : Fun little timewaster. Pretty addivtive
Matt R : Not sure what the draw is, here... Maybe people like the animations of the jelly people? Gameplay seems repetitive
A Google user : Fun graphics but poor controls, difficult to aim and advance. Uninstalled
Ran D : The game is fun, mix between Matrix and Gummy Candy. The physic in the game is amazing!! 10/10

Lewis Love : Addictive, fun and very satisfying. Great gameplay! Really need need to add a replay function 😁 thanks guys

Steven Kelly : Cant play through more than 3 enemies before it crashes. Fun game though.
