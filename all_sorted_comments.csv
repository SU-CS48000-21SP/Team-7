if only you can meet up with people that you met in the part right after the starting bit but other wise it's a good game update(i if you can now but when i played you could not),0
this game is very calm and amazingly fun to play  i already enjoyed myself playing this game for a minute or two. i reall recommend people to play this game. it has nice graphics you get to see other players and unlock friendship and you get to explore other worlds.,1
i can't open my sky because it crashes everytime i open it after update  please fix it fast devs! since feb 24 and i didn't even recieve compensation.,0
omg! this game is awesome i play everyday continuosly for 3 hour. this game have fantastic story with high graphics & music .,1
fun to play with friends and nice sceneries but  the video recording button in-game doesn't work on android(with clean scenery like ios),1
beautiful graphics. cute stuff. but struggle to get a lots of heart and candles  bcz need to farming,1
very entertaining and fun to play through. you're able to make goals to save up for capes and there's seasons that last up to 2-3ish months at a time with daily missions to earn candles. there's a huge amount of emotes and socializing with other players is easy and fun. you can hold hands with other players and sit on their shoulders. the story is really charming and the customization is great!!,1
this is the most beautiful game i've played in my life. it brings me a sense of inner peace and every world makes my soul sing with joy. the music is great  the animation is magnificent  the flying mechanics are easy to learn  and the story itself feels like something out of a whimsical fairy tale. this is definitely a game you should play if you want to escape the stress of the real world.,1
plsss fix your game i cannot enjoy playing anymore because the game won't run smoothly in my mobile phone device and i can't enjoy the game anymore... it's so sad because i like this game but can't enjoy it plsss fix it,0

i love this game so so much!! though the bugs are frustrating  i don't really care that much hahahahaha,1
5 star game  the graphics and story is amazing and i love the whole vibe of it  but after a while it's repetitive  i only get on to grind  there's no more joy in exploring and it's just boring   i wish there was more to do then just grind for candles but it's still an amazing game,1

this is a very relaxing game with beautiful graphics  music  and story.,1
if you want to have a relaxing time playing an adventure game with cute items and graphic i highly recommend,1
very beautiful game! although there some slip-ups with the flying  but i enjoy it overall!,1
this game is my new favorite! i love it so so much there are some minor bugs but otherwise it is awesome!!,1
i like the game because it's really amazing. because all those ghosts and new upgrades winging powers.,1
greatest game everrr!!! there are no bugs the graphics are grea,1
such good graphics very good detailed game really interesting makes you feel very concentrated and its quite peaceful and relaxing,1
tried to sign up  but the game is having server issues. y'all need to upgrade lol,0
this is an amazing game.. it can calm down a person a lot and the soothing music of it is amazing..,1
"this is a masterpiece  a game unlike anything else. it blows my mind that a mobile game could be so good. first of all is 100% free  +no ads this just shows how much passion and love was put to this game! the graphics and the music are just breathtaking it could easily be a pc or console game. plus the ""social features"" add a whole other level to this game. it is heavy tho and poor devices will lag a lot. for me the lag is minimal but still there  tho i would be surprised if it wasn't.",1
its absolutely breathtaking. you want art and relaxation? this is it. honestly i've never seen a 3d game a cinematic as this one. everything looks so good. so far the theme is also intriguing. now for the controls  they are still a bit hard to manipulate for precise maneuver. and theres a sort of co-op component  but communication is really hard. i hope they set a friend system so.,1
this game is a masterpiece. the music  graphic  gameplay  story are all great and even better when combined together  i recommend everyone to give it a try. however there are still some issues,1
a masterpiece. the graphics are stunning  each frame of gameplay looks cinematic. i also like the interaction that you can have with other players. cons ,1
absolutely love this game! the graphics and music are amazing and the storyline is captivating 100/100 update,1
i love it! this game is incredibly well made; from the stunning graphics to the overall game play  sky,1
the game gas great graphics  it's probably one of the best i've played on mobile. i only have one problem,1
start with the major downsides. you can't play with your iphone friends. there are bugs that leads to losses of an extremely limited resources which you cannot recover. else,0
this is game is so cute and aesthetic ,1
i do like the graphics  cool character outfits and all the expressions. it's a sooth and relaxing game. there are still many things to do with friends even though you explore the whole map  reborn many times  got alot of candles and start fooling around with the dragon and all. overall  it's a nice game. but i noticed that the price of some specific items keeps raising across time  not affordable(with my condition). it would be lovely if they were cheaper. ,1
a beautiful game  it has a heartfelt environment and immersive gameplay. edit,1
one of the best mobile games i have played so far. really well executed. the gameplay evokes a sense of mystery and exploration. you get to meet players from world over and there is a sense of cooperation and helping each other out which is great. at times one does feel a little lost but then it feels like a part of the game. nothing pushing you to rush anywhere yet you want to explore more and more. thank you for this. and guess what  no ads... ,1
it was a fun game to experience and explore but the storyline is really lacking. it very hard to interpret what the story is. the controls are not as tight with flight being very hard to steer at times. it's not made clear that once you get to edan  it's a total restart. you loss all your wings. there really isnt a reason to continue playing once you reach the end because it's just a repeat of a short game with cosmetics for your character. it's very beautiful and the music is amazing.,1
4.5/5 the game controls are fairly well developed - there are occasional glitches that occur but nothing that takes away from the overall experience. the quests keep you on your toes but sometimes it can be a chore... i'm still rather invested in the game because the visuals are absolutely fantastic and i would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys discovery-type games!,1
great music  great controlls. the reason i deducted the stars are  story is ambiguous. no voice-overs  no story  not sure what to do  not sure where to go  monsters!! really?? in this game! worlds are good  customization is limited. i give you 100 points for effort and music composition. looking forward to more games from you.,1
the game is a bit glitchy when flying and avoiding rocks in eden which makes it hard to control or get away fast. had a few problems with certain gates not downloading and had to re-install the game quite a few times for it to eventually work. lovely story! i'll definitely keep playing it. enjoyed playing journey on the ps4 so hopefully this game will also be added to the playstation store sometime in the future.,0
probably the best mobile game you'll find right now  minimal to no ads  really good graphics and beautiful sound design. sometimes you don't know what's going on and that's the beauty of it  it reminds me of journey  you may not know where you're going but the places you visit along the way are amazing. the only real 'problem' is that there's a tiny bit of lag and the graphics go down for budget phones  but with a game as ambitious as this  that's only expected,1
"fantastic game honestly. there's something for everyone. sky has puzzles  exploration  both peaceful and exciting moments  mystery and intrigue  lovely music and beautiful open maps on which to play. the best part is that even after ""completing"" the game  there's still more fun to be had what with periodic events. occasionally things get a bit buggy but these issues are mild  temporary  and largely overshadowed by the game's appeal. it really is a game for all different types of people.",1
not to complicated. good quality game. with easy and difficult levels.,1
this game is amazing and i love it.it has a very nice vibe to it i wonder what happened to badland2 anyone remember it?if you can bring back the game it would be appreciated,1
exceptional experience  real and good fun  definitely worth the price. a few minutes of joy with friends and family is priceless,1
it's very entertaining and all  but the ads get on my nerves! honestly!!!,1
love it. boy it makes me laugh and same times i want to launch my tab . perfect lol,1
absolute trash can  you can only play like 20 levels out of 400 and then the rest you have to pay nearly five dollars...,0
i used to play this all the time with family and we loved playing it. over all the game is perfect and awesome.,1
i really like this game  it had so many ways to be the best like theres a lot of strategizing involved  that being said it's really good overall good job,1
tooooo many ads. i cant enjoy this game without being asked to pay after every level.,0
play a game  lose a match  had to watch ads forcefully....ads with 30 seconds without skip,0
when you pay to remove ads  it actually removes all ads. kudos.,1
it has amazing graphics. i need badaland 2 3 4 5 6 etc . i am waiting for more levels nd graphics,1
simple stunning graphics  simple stunning controls  simply perfect gameplay,1
too many traps. stuck at the lasts level. only the developer can win this game.,0
its a realy hood game,1
i loved this game a lot... it's a single player and single finger game but this game is just unbelievable... everyone must try this game....,1
the most family friendly game even with so many deaths involved. forever best game~,1
badland is very nice game i recommend you also download this game and play this game graphics is insane and the controls are pretty challenging,1
creative and clever level design. simple fun with beautiful visuals and rich atmosphere,1
love this game.. frustrating as hell  but love it for it..,1
there are too many add while playing the game. overall game experience is good but adds ruin it totally,0
there are to many ads in this game  its either watch all these ads or buy our premuim  you dont want our premium? well watch these ads then.,0
there's like 4 levels unless you upgrade to premium sucks and was a waste of time,0
im not one to criticize ads but seriously at least let me exit out  if the ads are gonna be that frequent let people exit out. please fix it,0
this game is amazing. i had it a while back on my old phone and the atmosphere along with just a fun game makes this overall great,1
maybe i'm missing something but with no controller it doesn't play well. also it was a bit boring.,0
i am so glad that i already played and finished this game years ago when these people were not greedy for money..... your ads suck.,0
osam i like this game so much ..its a very good game i had ever plaid .... thanku thos who made this game.. the graphic was so beautyfull and i like the beautyfull back ground sound ...,1
one of the best two players i've ever played good control and graphics,1
full of lag and bug   specially on lazers. my phone is galaxy s10 it doesnt have any problem but on this game my phone get freezed o dont know whats the probleb but i hope they fix it beacause its great game.,0
too much ads and you can't even skip them,0
you can not get any achievements on google play games unless you are connected to internet! and when you are connected to the internet badland becomes ad-land!,0
it is vary fun and i like how you can make your own and over all it is a good game.,1
this is my childhood. game soo i want it too try again and it was still fun as always,1
ads!! if there wasnt ads so often it would be perfect.,0
too much ads every time i die there's a 15 second ad and i'm not that good so its annoying,0
amazing game. love the graphics  gameplay  and aesthetic.,1
this game is worth the size of 100+ mb its feel veary good whike playing it  and i'm running on 833.3mb ram tablet and its amazing  keep the work up creators!,1
brilliant nice very hard for everyone but if you try this game then you feel like the game is easy  so try it,1
best game ever...too hard but too good... just wonderful... i installed 6-7 games but i didn't like them...but i am really impressed by this game...superb...,1
a very good game but too much ads but it is a very good game after all it is the free version,1

just takes me to a black screen where i can't do anything but listen to the main menu music,0
i absolutely love it  as well as me and my brother can play it together and we are always having so much fun and laugh!,1

this game is amazing great graphics levels and really fun to play keep up the good work,1
i love this game so much the quality is amazing and the levels get harder and harder i play this game every day and never get bored! great jod developer it is amazing,1

perfect couch multiplayer game  with support of multiple controller on a single phone.,1
this is a very good game if you considering to buy the full game you should.,1
unique and very interesting game + challenging,1
i like the game very much the smootheness of graphics is superb.keep going developers.,1
this game is exceptional it's simple calm and relaxing it's a distressor and a anxiety releaser.,1
addictive game if you have been a fan of classic flappy bird. this feels like flappy bird 50.0,1
i really like the forest and the adventure in the game in the unknown creatures it really brings out the name of the game badland,1
this game is great i can get frustrated at times but once you beat it then you just have to move on to the next,1
badland was an amazing experience. me and my so have spent many days playing this fantastic game in co op on our nvidia shield,1
it is very very hard game super game i only completed day one it should be game of the year and it is not like pubg it's multiple super,1
cool but u need to pay for playing other days and u cant play multiplayer or world levels because of that ads,0
this is one of the first mobile games i've ever played  and it still holds up years later. definitely earned my money,1
four long adds between each lvl  would have been a good game but completely ruined by adds,0

nice game it is really fun no ads so i rate it 5 stars,1
worstest app ever  never install this app. only adds are there . play 1 minute and get 4-5 long adds without skip option worstest app,0
i have had this game for about 10 min now. and i haven't been able to play it. honestly  it's because of ads.,0
the game is so lagging that from the upper levels it lags so much that one time i thought that my phone had just totally wasted.,0
best game ever played just love this.graphics are astonishing and also its amazing with earphones.,1
i hate all of the ads and stuff you have to watch every time you finish level,0
many ads and all of them take 30 seconds. thats too much.,0

ads is horrible. unplayable. too bad it's a good game,0
the game is full of ads..& becoming very much irritating.worst thing in any application or game,0
too many ads. advertised on other apps 3 a week charge to play this,0
worst game ever. whenver i try to play it shows me to upgrade to premium and then close the game.,0
its ok for group play but they should really make the solo levels more interesting and way more harder,1
l love this app soo much! but since when did you add true co-op and since when was there build a level?!? i am a old player,1
so addictive i've played it all day & i've finished all levels it's a fun game & great graphics,1
when i was younger i would play this like crazy! and i think i should get it again for fun,1
simple  alive  easy to learn hard to master  this game time well spent,1

it is a great game and things are so cute four players can play in it good graphics,1
i keep getting a bug where when i start playing everything beckmes echoed and it ruins the sound,0
it's so inspiring and beautiful of some people's lifestyle like mine it is fit exactly and made for me to play thanks creator,1
a little strange story  amazing graphics  really. if you haven't played it yet  you really should (also i'm really glad that theres level creator),1
an ad after every stage. more time with an ad than playing.,0
very good game  runs smoothly with no bugs and the art style is beautiful,1
i love this game it's so cool!!!! because i only love it and my friends always die and i gave five (5) stars and littrely so funny play it now like 1000 persent i realy love it do you love it? then play it! i hope you love it!!!,1
it's unusual and strangely alluring. .....i like the graphics.,1
the worst app ever it gives advertising every minute the worst please don't download   you'll regret it.,0
very fun and challenging. but it has alot of ads though,1
too much adds. please consider those on paid mobile plans without wifi access.,0
ads in every level was so annoying so i uninstalled it... i hate this game thank you,0
everywhere i look there's just ads and ads and more ads!!!!!,0
good game  simple  nice graphics and good gameplay.,1
ads are unnecessarily frustruating i watch ads more than i play the actual game.,0
beautifully crafted world. challenging and engaging to play.,1
i don't care about the ads i think it is a great game which is different to anything else i have played before,1
this game is so amazing! my friends are laughing and we enjoy the game and the hard levels,1
too many ads in this game which doesn't worth the money aking for premium version,0
i think this is a great game it is so chill the graphics are so good it is a really good game i love the background noise,1
really cool and addictive. the sound effects are spectacular,1
amazing graphics and awesome sounds. addictive and highly recommend,1
combines elements from many of my previous favourite games. play is so cleaverly addictive!,1
its quite delicious and appetizing  contains some nice ingredients and looks good,1
amazing art  and a great time killer. i higly reccomend this game.,1
it is a nice game but there are some levels that have no logic it is super unique game,1
love the level designer .also i really like the graphics.,1
it was such an amazing game that tested your brain. definetly a game worth getting.,1
always shows the annoying message to upgrade to premium   this game is greedy,0
theres not much to say  its just the best indie game i have ever played! so many levels!( )!,1
it's a fantastic adventure with a great level editor! and it's all free!,1
an ad after each attempt at a level! come on!,0
too much ads  this game is more like advertisement. com,0
i finished all the one player free levels. it was a good experience,1
stop trying to force me to buy the premium version and i've only been playing a game for 10 mins.,0
i'm rating 1 bc it just none stop ads if i say no to whach a vid for a skin it still makes me whach it just no prize fix it,0
awesome graphics  i rly love this soundtrack   its amazing   i sz this game!!,1
one of the bestest game i have played ever...a mysterious sound effects....full of.silence and peace....what a game great...,1
great app!! as i was seeing the ad some game pop up in my phone nice concept of watching ad.,1
screen movement goes too fast before i can get my guy unstuck  please fix the screen move bug,0
destroyed what was once a very good game with adverts...uninstalled.,0
challenging and relaxing  really brings out the satisfaction of survival,1
i love this game so much they did a great job on the game concept but the best thing about this game is the level maker,0
amazing! i'm 8 years old   love the style and sound effects.,1
that's an awesome game right there love the visual everything is just beyond brilliant,1
it's good because u can play with your friends on the same divice and you can play on co-op,1
best game out there. beautiful graphics and control.,1
a very nice game but please add online multiplayer in it to make it the best game in the world,1
absolutely brilliant game but over time its get to difficult to collect more clones,1
too many adds  they make a good game completely annoying and unplayable,0
it's a very good game. i really enjoyed and loved playing the game and i am very much entertained... keep it up,1
this is so fun and tricky! i enjoyed a lot. it's just amazing thanks for the game dev,1
great graphics and sounds. very entertaining!,1
i remember plaing this game at a phone store  but when i got my phone i did not remember the name  of the game so now i found it.,1
just amazing  there art is so cute  plus   the app works perfectly!,1
it sucks that i have to play an ad after every level. disgusting,0
great gameplay. would be better if it had a storyline.....,1
literally played this for ages and finished it a few times and i think it's addicting too and i love it ,1
this game is not good when am trying to play it says badland has stopped. like b i want to play.,0

having a lot of fun  addicting good for spending spare time,1
it's a great game. i would give 5 stars but controlling is very bad,1
pretty fun game. the progression is at a good pace and the graphics are cute. i also like the multi-touch to split group.,1
not a bad little game! if you're a d and d fan! new gamers probably won't like this game! if you grew up on atari and intellivision! it's perfect!,1
i'm not bluffing but this is probably the most fun i've had playing a game ever if u don't download ur missing out on a lot of fun!,1
a totally addictive game.if you are bored because of old games then give it a try.you'll not be bored,1
addicting! this is what i call a unique and smart game. there's nothing like this on the store!,1

needs a better way to level up,0
good game with cool tactical gameplay,1
rating prompts after less than 10 minutes playing = 1*,0

simple  and engaging game that you can play anywhere without data. what can i say. its perfect,1
awesome and super amusing game. funky and appealing graphics. really gets you emerged in a simple fashion.,1

it's a good game grate graphics and very nice control's this game is so fun,1
awesome tap button rpg. i have enjoyed thus far.,1
i always wanted a strategy game on the phone  this is a real time  very basic strategy game with puzzle elements,1
a great concept but it doesn't use the formation mechanic nearly enough.,0
great game but too many ads.... like to play some more games like this,1

this is the best puzzle game . i loved it . it is somewhat different and unique from other games . i have faced some difficulties and problems while making your own card overall it is the best,1
small standalone puzzles  no time limit for solving the puzzles  good game controls  i found it both challenging and not repetitive in nature,1
this game is just absolutely cool! i mean  good graphic  great music  simple gameplay (but brain-teasing). awesome  absolutely awesome!,1
i like this game a lot but in some levels you can't move character to the spot the want it to also most of the the levels are hard and confusing to figure out please fix this,0
simple. relaxing. well designed. i especially love the way the background music syncs to your touch inputs.,1
its a very satisfying and challenging puzzle type of game  and it also runs very smooth  im hoping for more levels and features in the future ,1
i got stressed out how to complete the puzzle but that's what it got to be more thriller  also i really love the background music  it relaxes my ear.,1

challenges short but very well constructed. graphics simple but captivating. great game. second time that i played something from this dev. will follow his next works.,1
fun little game. smooth gameplay and nice graphics. ads aren't interruptive. the game is free but you can pay as much as you want.,1
for less than 5mb you're getting a decent game. puzzles will keep you going and the game loads fast and is very smooth. this was my second time downlpading this because i finished it the first time.,1
good time pass  i still think it needs more improvements  like it takes a lot of time to move  which is a little annoying after sometime.,0
the artwork is enticing with a chearful aftertaste  and the design layout is creatively alluring. i look forward to playing and am super happy to have discovered this gem. thank you!,1
i love this game a lot! the robot is so cute to walk around and it makes me went jeehhdusisooaodbxnxmxbbanaj. the ads not really bother me that much than the other game which is cool. the puzzles are a bit tricky and entertaining  keep it up a good work developers! ,1
well playing it is fun and more fun is creating your own level. it would be more fun if that created levels we could share to our firends and challenge them. also time specific level should also be added thanks a lot to the developer and team,1
beautiful graphics. charming little droid. it's a great game to forget about your troubles for a time with a little challenge on the side.,1
this game is so cute and pleasant! and some of the hard levels make your brain work like crazy  and thats what i like in puzzle games. thank you for making such a nice one,1
really challenging and amaxing way to pass the time but not waste it. really top notch puzzle game. thanks for making it.,1
this is the best game. it is challenging and entertaining at the same time. this game is a full pack with calming music  tough levels & has dunking the ball level too. this is a very genuine game i shall recommend it to everyone i know.,1
this is the most beautifully implemented game of its genre that i have seen in many years. quite delightful to play!,1
the robot and its movements are adorably cute! the person who designed the background music and made it play according to the users' clicks is a genius.,1
easy gameplay. cool graphics. overall awesome puzzle game and the interface is awesome. the best is thing is there is no ads.,1
gameplay is simple  but the puzzle solving is satisfying if a tad repetitive. amazing graphics  simple controls.,1
this is just awesome. no ads only fun. neat and clean. this game is the benchmark where every other game needs to reach. no personal data asked for. no sign in required. just play. and yes efforts taken should be appreciated.,1
its a good game for time pass and it increases our memory power to think in different ways to win the game .not only for game it is use full for our lifes too.it helps us to learn how overcome our problems by ourselfs with the help of blocks(friends ) and to finally win the game thankyou for making this game mekorama i heartfully thank every one who did hard work for making this game success note,1
one of the best relaxing and mind intutive apps i've ever seen ...cool graphics...no frustrating timers...no advertisment...and the best of all the developer lets you to decide how much money you want to pay/donate,1
amazing ! the game is so fun to play  it is challenging and at the same time not frustrating! i love the graphics as well!!,1
really love this game  one issue,1
i love the game.. i usually give up playing these kinda games. but mekorama is just difficult to give up on.. i mean.. i just don't feel like giving up till i solve it.. n it also helps in our thinking skills.. n all.. overall i loved the game..,1
it's a real nice 'idea' behind this game and graphics are so nice. it's a kind of game which keep you bound with it. and finally the work of developers is admirable.,1
this is really a good game! i finished all of the 50 levels and i'm proud. th levels was hard  but finally i could solve this.. if you love challenging yourself.. you should try this game. it's addictive and frustating.. wkwk.,1
the graphic and artstyle of the game is classical and nice . fun and creative gameplay. best game for those who like puzzle type games . great time killer.,1
very nice cool interesting and of course very much difficult... the starting levels are very easy but as levels increase the difficulty of the game also increases very nice brain game,1
i like the fact that you can design your own levels and scan the one's others have made it means you can never truly finish the game.,1
so cute! being able to rotate the camera more to see different angles might help a little but its definitely worth playing! its nice that its free  too.,1
this game is totally amazing . i love this game . i completed all the levels and now i am playing community level . they are most amazing . but add more levels and elements . and you can continue the levels in other planets,1
"i like it. martin magni  your game is one of the top 10 physical games and i have a letter for you. ""dear martin magni  mekorama is a good game  i know that a little bot needs to go back to the planet he's traveling  and i can help finish the game... but i couldn't pass the following levels",1
excellent! i don't normally do reviews but this game is awesome. the puzzles get you thinking and for the space it takes up in your drive it is excellent. and it is free!,1
it's cute. idk why i love it   it doesn't eating so much storage in my phone   and the gameplay is entertaining   just like i'm bored or waiting someone   i have this game to be played while waiting . the puzzle and the cute robot it's what i like from his game  thanks for making this game developer,1
game is a great time killer and really appreciate the logic in every level. the higher the level the hardest it is to finish.,1
best game in a long time!! i flipping love this game! challenging  quirky & addictive there's 1 level i can't finish due to my tiny phone screen. but otherwise a phenomenal game.,1
it is good game but when player enters in room or something like that the outer structure should become transparent so that we can see inside structure plus there should be more camera rotations and brief description written with name of levels,0
giving this one star since i literally can't rate it. why? damn thing won't even open. i click it both from the app store and my home page  it just opens to the developer name  then stops. when i go to running apps it doesn't even say it's running. might help to make your game uhm  actually open long enough for game play?,0
the design and animations are amazing. the developer is very skilled. buuuut  there is no challenge at all.,1
the game is absolutely addictive once you get a feel for it. the controlls are simple and smooth with a simple objective in the game.,1
delightful game which is beautifully made and a nice balance between challenging but relaxing. great design and ad free  easily worth paying for!,1
i absolutely love this game. great visual and gameplay also love the ui. i almost never get bored playing this game. i really appreciate the developer for making this game. surely would try to support them. highly recommended.,1
amazing game the graphics   the music and the mechanics the only thing that needs improving is the fact that the bot doesn't return inside of the maze when it accidentally flies away from it,1
this game is very enjoyable even though it's not very challenging. it's similar to monument valley  so if you enjoyed that game  you will like this as well. i appreciate the relaxing nature of this game. it functions well and you can tell that the devs put forth a lot of love creating this. very nice job!,1
this is the best puzzle game ever. i will never delete this game. i recommend all humans old / young to download this game. i write this review because i can't pay  sorry martin magni.,1
this game is kinda wasted potential. this could be as popular as gd if he keep updating it and if he were really serious with it. this game still fun  but its just your clasic 2016 mekorama  really nothing new this game editor really simple and doesn' t require you to have at least 80 in logic  it just you  your hamd and creativity. that it if magni is releasing mekorama 2 im sure everyone will exited about it,1
this was the best game app i have ever played. this is really a challanging app. it forces you to think in a logical manner. its graphics are really brilliant at very less mb. i recommend everybody who likes to play some brainstorming games to download this app.,1
so simple yet difficult (several times) to reach the spot. and the buildings are beautiful. nice game to take a break and pass the time.,1
a fun game that has you solving puzzles  the robot is cute  some are quite challenging and frustrating but you keep on coming back for more,1
"it's very nice game. this game needs so much brain sometimes to solve a puzzle that i start getting feeling that this game is challenging me and saying ""solve this if you have enough nerves""",1
brilliant game  fun  smooth  well designed and executed. plus no annoyances or grinding. needs to be more games like this.,1
lovely game! levels are just challenging enough to be fun without being frustrating. i'd love to support the creators financially  but money is a little tight right now. ,1
perfect game... makes you think a lot and doesn't really give you a free pass. you have to pay for hints and which i think is smart.,1
the game mekorama let me tell you guys that i don't know where to start. simple to put this is that it's challenging and needs more levels. i would love to see more games out there like this one,1
i love this game. the style is so cute and the puzzles are so interesting and the little stumble that the robots do when you move something too fast makes me feel bad.,1
i don't have the money to give you but this is a super game. that the player can create the game. awesome experience. small app but really intresting game i recommended to all of my friends,1
a must play. edit,1
wow! this one is an awesome puzzle with the best mini 3d lego look alike. love to play it. keep up the good works  dev. ,1
the puzzle are good but some of is not especially when clicking inside a building. you cant move inside. and also the camera angles should be free  not fixed.,0
it is a very nice games and it's main character is also so cute and the thing that gave it five stars is that is has a feature to build your own level and it is only of 9 mb .wow so much fun only for 9 mb. the game is much better than any 30 to 40 mb games so i really really recommend you but i should give my opinion to the company that you should have given an gmail log in so that our progress remains to ourself if the games is deleted by chance that happened to me . thanks for this cool game.,1
this game makes me comfortable... it makes my stress gone and satisfying motions and smoothness... and less mb and no ads supports.. i love it for real.. even it makes me confuse but still i learned alot of strategies...,1
kudos to the developer for such a game...which is simple to understand but complex to solve at the same time. demands out of the box thinking and creativity to solve levels. what a gameplay. (p.s. pls add new levels soon. ),1
excellent. game  design  music and execution. simple but intriguing. ads are not annoying at all.,1
i actually like this game  since it's had a good graphics  but i don't like the view  it's not flexible  i hope he fixed it on next update..,0
what a wonderful graphics. absolutely challenging  fun  addictive and friendly game. and big thanks there's no ads in this. thanks for making this  martin.,1
love it  awesome puzzles (kind of 3d) some easy some hard. you can build your own puzzles and play other people puzzles (big bonus in my opinion  people make great puzzles). very recommend!!,1
this is a wonderful little game. simple puzzles with some lovable little robots. highly recommend and even paid for it on my wife's account. worth every penny!,1
worst controls in this or any other world's games dammed controls are so frustrating. i have been level 28 trying for more than half a year....... please fix this issue ...,0
i like this game. this game is really excellent. it is quite simple with mind-blowing graphics. after level 27 it become quite hard.,1
i love this game so much!! this game is so challenging and fun! i haven't found any bugs so far  the ads aren't annoying and the design is so cute! the developers of this game deserve five stars,1
i love it  the graphics and all but one thing i wanted an update that has wide world so i can place block more and then make a new items too like doors chairs ect thats all like if you want this update,0
the game is simple and yet has powerful graphics which doesn't seem like it. it would be great if you can show the number of stars in the game on the screen above hint icon. i have to pause the game and check for the number of stars there.,0
i love this game! it's just great like hopeinggo always says it's great because it's great. anyway i give it 5/5 it's a really fun game you can make your own level it's just great i even made a captain toad level,1
totally dumb game. no tutorial  no video of how it's gonna work. just a block and have to go throw it with no jump animation either. either keep watching ads to get same hint again and again or pay money to get subscription,0
seconds into the game it's already stopped working. every time i swipe to move the platform  the whole diorama moves instead. there's no way to differentiate commands.,0
this game was 4mb as far as i remember with same excellent graphic back then when i used to play 6 years back. 10mb yet with all the updates these years is impressive. reinstalled it  got fine memories with it.,1
relaxing  peaceful and i get to take my time?? followed by really great graphics and simple controls? and i get to feel smarter? you've had my curiosity  but you now have my attention. bravo  devs!,1
a nice  chill game that requires a bit of logical flexing and some sharp eyes. it's fun still to revisit levels you're done with. thanks  martin!,1
i have been playing this for a long time and this is one of the best puzzle games i've ever played and even better because you can build your own levels!! anyways happy new year!!!,1
games that need your brain work more. good games  but sometimes its hard for move when the character inside the building,0
i really love the game. very addictive  cute and funny. no ads  only fun. i greatly recommend if you like puzzle games.,1
an absolutely adorable little bot. i don't normally review apps but this is so different than anything else i've played  very well made and worth sitting down in your free time to play,1
it's a good game but i found a really funny glitch in level 8. you have to tell the robot to go to a circle and when he's almost touching it lift it up very fast doing this will push the robot out of the map but good game,0
very unique game and new concept. every level is kind of new challenge. i had to uninstall this game because my kid was addicted to this.,1
its awsome because you can build some things and you can tap the master button if you want to play hard level's this was an amazing game keep it up,1
a fantastic game that makes my brain think..... each level is different in its own way........love the game.... hope to get additional levels........,1
really good game puzzling mind i have made many level . can you please tell me how to register my level .? give new author chance to register whose ever level is best you think. also give reward to new author. hopes  you will think on it at last really interesting game,1
amazing puzzles. gets difficult progressively. love the music in background it's so relaxing as well so,1
great  smart game. not much ads. gear  funny characters. nice gameplay and interesting and sometimes funny levels,1
best lite weight game with amazing graphics and realy mindboggling puzzles. it must be topping the charts..,1
i cannot upload my levels due to qr code decompression. i don't know why but if i compare my level's qr code to other levels  my level's code is tightly packed into a medium-size square  unlike the other level's code which literally fills up the entire qr code box. please fix this issue.,0
good game  too time consuming  after a quick teabreak game. suits kids  not for me. takes too long to load! not for me. refund my expensive uk data at 80mb for 2 plays now! time wasting. deleted asap! cute graphics! 2/1/22. uk review,0
wow this game is of only 10 mb then alo so many great physics and graphics it is having and very smooth add free and bug free game i loved ur work but  you should add multiplayer to it so it could be great thing pllzzzzzzzzzzz.........,1
very creative gameplay experience. well thought out. not a cheap money grab like so many other games.,1
phenomenal game! very addicting and challenging. minimal ads. you must download this.,1
awesome little game to get your brain thinking. great graphics. easy to control.,1
great  fun puzzle game. the levels are well thought and challenging.,1
really good and relaxing game. good graphics  cute characters and challenging. gives the option for u to pay any amount you want,1
plays great and looks great. cunning  ingenious puzzles. the occasional ads aren't intrusive or annoying at all.,1
the best ever game. music is relaxing. game is smooth interesting and you need out of box thinking abilities. i just loved it.,1
best puzzle game i've ever played. the game has good 3d graphic and very challenging  that's how a puzzle is supposed to be. nice,1
interesting game but robots are difficult to control through a maze. i stopped playing when the fun stopped. couldn't finish nor want to try again.,0
this game is really mind boggling. it's very simple yet brilliantly designed to include it's complexity within the simplicity. mr. melodrama  the cute little robot's movements are extremely natural and childish. i sometimes felt sad for abusing him to finish the game. anyway this game makes you think deeply. it evokes the thinker in you.,1
this game is both cute and challenging! it also allows you to skip a level if you get stuck. very well-designed game!,1
what a cute and beautiful game. it is amazing and addictive. need i say more. very simple though could get tricky once a while. a game worth wasting your time on,1
yay  25 new levels. and the irrtating static view has changed so i can navigate 360. thanks martin for this amazing game. the music is the best part ,1
very challenging puzzle levels. even more challenging 3d puzzle builder mode. and sharing created levels with other users! well done.,1
awesome game! such a cute character. early levels are quite easy but the game gradually gets both more challenging and more addictive!,1
what a wonderful outstanding game!! it's so sure that this will mess with everybody's brain. i'm sure that you have made an extraordinary effort to develop this. truly amazing. i give my extraordinary congrats to you. keep it up. looking forward to mekorama 2....,1
absolutely brilliant! not boring. no bothersome ads. martin you did great! keep it up. very entertaining. no puzzle unbeatable  but not easy either,1
i like this game  it's relaxing  not time consuming. i can play it while rest my feet  and the music...aahh it's simple but give me back my good mood,1
a great way to pass time   it's has nice graphics and awesome gameplay. i suggest buying premium to get a hint when it's too hard.,1
this game is great! it's a fun little puzzler with excellent sound design. it's worth trying out to listen to the music alone.,1
as the level of this game increses  difficulty level as well as curiosity increses. interesting logical game. one more thing about this game is that if you want a hint to solve any level you will have to pay 30inr  50inr  100inr & so on. if you are not able to pay then  no problem you won't proceed if you like the game you can write a review  wow ! what an idea sir ji ! i suggest this game.,1
simply the best mobile game ever. no exaggeration. challenges one to think creatively. and shout out to the creative efforts that went into the app's design motif  consistent fluid feel and just the entire experience. hands down martin magnificent is a g  see what 25years of mastering your craft brings forth. ,1
the game is quite interesting as well as engrossing. the levels are well designed and provide with challenges to overcome. loved it!,1
this is an awesome game. it is challenging but not impossible and the graphics are enchanting and readable. l highly recommend this game.,1
i love the way this game challenges my brain to solve it but one issue is that it's impossible to scan the tiny qr codes when i make my own levelsso i can send them to my friend for testing othe than that its amazing,0
best game to pass time. they even gave built in simulator. it's awseome . i loved this game  suggestion,1
it's an awesome game! my kids love solving each puzzle and driving meko to the red dot. it's such a lovely character!,1
fun  difficult but doable  pleasing 3d graphics. cleverly thought out  small game to download  good have to go in and out of when there's time,1
one of the best brain teasers  the background music changes with patter of your click. thanks to the developer.. for not adding ads to it.,1
maze solving with verticality. a very entertaining and engaging game with apt sounds. a very good blend of the concepts. this is the game that i usually recommend to my friends. kudos to the developer.,1
martin. you've done a great job with this game. the fact that you let us play it for free and then left it to us to determine it's value is incredible. i have never seen any developer do this and it's nothing short of brilliant. you obviously worked hard on this game and judging from the love it's gotten it paid off! congratulations! looking forward to your future projects.,1
the game isn't puzzling  it's fustrating. why would u make the character move involuntarily towards tazers and bots. it's borderline annoying. also stop asking for money so frequently. did u want the game to be free for everyone to play or did u think it wasn't worth paying for? just label a price on the app store or add a place to donate for it.,0
really having fun with this. great art style. fun  challenging puzzles. but lowkey and casual. i love it!,1
loved this game alot  completed a couple of times but still never got bored. eagerly waiting for next version...yeah i know we can download different levels from browser but still just waiting for more. do try this game guys you'll love it for sure.,1
the game's amazing....i have tried many games over time...and its one of the very good games' category that i would put this game in. it's not very addictive so won't kill ur precious time and it's fun...so overall....good games for everyone looking for a rest time game,1
i love it. its tricks the mind  but the music and beautiful simple graphic dilutes the pressure and make it such a soothing and refreshing game.,1
this game was good  it also has options for designing your own level  but you have to purchase the hints. that's the only drawback. overall a very cute game.,1
i could have given 5 star but some issues is found by me. we can't upload our levels in forums. after completing 3 levels it will show black screen and we again have to play that same level. these are only my issues please say me that how to upload our levels in forums. thank you!,0
this game us really nice... has a good graphics very simple concept i love the levels... it is easy at first and becomes tough at last... we can even create our own levels... it is a very simple but an intresting... funny... good timepase game... try this game it is really a cool game...,1
very nice  free and engaging puzzle game after a very long time. 50 levels only but very worth it. knocked it off in 1 day.... worth it,1
the robot is too  dang cute! wish i can hug it! the puzzles are challenging  but fun! and the sick update! nice one!,1
this game is 5*****. it keep me going and going. the programmer has done a fantastic job in creating the many many different fun and challenging level. well done.,1
i wonder if the developers have thought about trying this game in with lego... the game could be adapted and models actually built as sets... obviously the automation wouldn't be there but the possibilities would be endless just as with the game,1
very interesting...and tricky game... it's for all ages... the graphics is really so good...has to apply your brain...and it can help to develop the geometrical view,1
"too many ads  but fun idea. it asks that you allow ads ""sometimes"" but it's an ad after every level.",0
i find the game challenging. though at times frustrating  as it is unclear how to move certain pieces. but so far it has been intriguing.,1
i think it's an amazing game for it's like 6 mbs of data  the puzzles  the physics  the graphics are all awesome  definitely keeping this hidden gem on my new phone!,1
the game has a lot to do with our brain. it provides us puzzle-like experience. for 10mb  this is the best game that i would recommend.,1
little bit hard  the grapichs is good  me n my sis play this at hospital  n she's fun with this  but when we reach high level that w so harddd.... i cant understnd  but its worth it  i like it!,1
really interesting app with brain chllenging levels. if someone likes puzzles they should definately try this game once. the graphics are really great.,1
it might be relaxing for many people because a soft back ground music makes the game enjoyable but for me that experience lasted for some time only i got bored of the game quickly . still it was nice.,0
an utterly ridiculously awesome game. it's creative  intuitive and above all appealing to the eyes and ears. thank you for making this game.,1
good game i like it. you can build your own levels. i have a trick that you can make two rooms and say choose a room. one room will have zappers and other will have finish point. and trick your friends now!!!!,1
the game is really interesting and fun. it makes us think a lot to solve those puzzles. i really preffer this game if u like to solve puzzles.,1
i love this game. its so challenging and addictive. u can't find a better game than this that is this size. thr developer really put his effort into this. it's amazing. i showed my siblings and they are addicted to it. thumbs up,1
good game. i love it  the tiny robot is so cute  even my son and brother download it too! finally  after stuck for 3 days  i figured out to beat level 19! you're genius  martin! finished all the cards. the best game ever!,1
great graphics and animation. puzzles are challenging and not repetitive. good background sounds.,1
it's the best game ever like literally everyone is giving it 4 to 5 stars you should get i am so glad i got it! you have to go to play store and get it!but the only problem is that you can't play the levels you make only the ones the game provides you!,0
one of the best games ever created. easy controls  smooth working and interesting levels i love this game i finished it but i want to do more please update this best graphics too.,1
the game has been designed excellently. the game designer has done an excellent job here. the idea of the game is really innovative. the game is thought provoking . and unlike other games it is hardly 5mb. over all an excellent game.,1
very nice.i really enjoy with the puzzles. i can't make it at first.then i think and think at last i made it. thank you,1
very nice game could improve more in future by adding more in games like shooting or something more interesting to develop or reach through more audience also name it coming mekarama as 2.0 and so on just my opinion and thank you for creating a awesome app like this.. i be a coder i know how hard work your team put on this ..app..,1
i found the game back  installed when it was new after so many years i found it again. nostalgia.,1
this is probably the best mobile /tablet app game i have seen!!! excellent graphics with the cutest loveable character!!! simple to play and totally addictive. if i was employed and could afford it i'd happily support the developer!!!! absolutely marvellous!!!!!,1
this is totally a game worth playing. i'm also surprised by the developers hardwork put into it  the game is small in size  fun to play  ads are decent and not put on your face  and they constantly improve the game. good job.,1
this game is awesome you should definitely give it a try.. it tests your brain in such a cute way that you won't be able to figure it out.. also thanks for the developers who did it finely well.. i can't pay you so as you said to write a review.. this is the best game for me.. plus it is a promise that i'm never gonna uninstall this game.. please keep developing such games.. hope this helps you a lot..,1
the game is okay but why is it that some features are not working. an example is the vertical lifts how do you bring them down?,0
its a good brain roasting game . according to me and my known players this game should many of its bugs and unknown tricks should be told . and last but not the least a vertical orbit moving should also be involved in this game.,0
it would be useful and cool to add gears  sensors  sequenced  multiplayer  suspension  and timer thing.,0
love this! it is challenging and fun! the ads are brief so not that bad.,1
great game  the android doesn't follow directions 100%  but good puzzle game and very difficult,1
i have played this game n number of times and also remember this is more than 6 years old..i was bored so i downloaded this and i was really upset this has got those stars thing with was kinda annoying and the main this ads i have to watch a 7 sec or 5 sec after finishing each i am very disapointed with the ads the stars i had soo mad i litreally deleted the game i had played this from 2015 till 2018 and then today i downloaded and this much change i had to deleted one of my fav game so fast,0
it's a great game  i like to play this after stressful school time  even the background music is awesome. the best part is that you can even create your own level  amazing right?,1
these game is so intresting i want more level and martin magni you are really legend i have no words for you your game are inspiring me i used your these app 3yers ago and i complete all levels of these game and leave it but now it was change and you made it perfect all the best for you new games,1
okay no1,1
its a great game . i played the game 3 years ago now that i am getting it back i am regretting deleting it. tip,1
great game and great author. this is the kindest a game developer has ever been  that i don't have to pay for anything and i can just pay what i want for what it's worth. it's just great! all the other developers should be kind like you. thank you for this beautiful game,1
this was super cool to be honest. i like the game and so unique and easy app. i enjoy alot . thank you so much admin! i was looking for a game and this game was fun,1
it is a really great game but sometimes there are glitches in the game while editing . i can't pay for it (cuz i'm 11 years old )but it is my dream game i love it,1
the game is made very well but it has one drawback that is the screen also moves while using the lift.,0
i love how challenging it is and you can even make your own games  cause i have already made like three.,1
best game ever .... i love this game very much... the walk of that robot is very funny when the level increases the game is very difficult to play,1
interesting game. the builder is a plus. you can build your own levels. seems like this dev might have a good head on his shoulders,1
playing for the second time after 6 years  nothing much has changed which is fine by me because it's a perfectly balanced game.,1
best game. no bug . i love this game because we also build our levels and levels of this game are best . i suggest you to download this game .,1
clever and challenging game of logic with help when you need it. just about perfect,1
it is so muck exciting game. i think that i should give it 5 stars but aftee playing i consider that it's camera angle is not effective it should be changed like 3d angle avoiding only rotating it. we can't play with this camera angle change it.,0
the reason why i gave it 1 star is that in this game all levels should have a boundary best when i played one master level that is pinball always the ball goes outside the boundary which is very irritating,0
very nice game with unique features like ,1
simple concept  cute character  challenging mazes. not complicated  not boring. thank you for making this game.,1
touch interface is ridiculous. must have pressed twenty times on a target  and no response.,0
really amazing game and one of the best 3d puzzle games in the store  also the art style is really great and the option to create your own levels is great.,1
i enjoying this game and i can create a level too  ads that pop pup every where that not bother me. i love this game so much,1
a very good game it is fun and have challenging levels in this game we can create our own level and play it graphics game play and controls are very good and the robot is also very cute and it trains your brain it is a brain game and it is in only 5.4 mb so less space it takes on your mobile in amazing performance who likes puzzle games thus is the best game for them very good keep it up martin magni i am waiting for a new game or update nice kkep it up,1
it's a great game. stable application no ads no fancy items. clean ui. it's good to play when ur alone and good brain exercise.,1
i can't put it down the robot is easy to move while still being challenging and the navigation becomes trickier and trickier to get each level there is so much to think through i love it thank you,1
this game is fun especially when you can create hard levels your self. my one complaint is this wheel level that is impossible to beat for me. but its is still fun.,0
this is such a great little game! fun  challenging at times. great time filler. the work that must have gone into designing it  credit to them.,1
very creative idea of gaming and the challenging levels. and the most gamer thing about this game is you can create your own levels and can submit. brilliant... loved it...,1
its challenging  engaging  addictive and overall just a fun game. its definitely worth a download and basically have 0 complaints about it. it's a fun pass time!,1
there is 1 problem that i build level and when it is time to play it starts but after sometimes automatically it will cut off the game in between when i playing my own created level . i request you to please resolve this problem fast as you can and get your 5 back .,0
one of the best puzzle based game. nice design and short levels that's interesting and challenging and fun to play.,1
great puzzle game to pass the time. very relaxing sound track and fantastic learning curve,1
do download.... logical game with puzzly levels. i felt confused at beginning but it is the easiest game i ever played as i went forward winning the levels,1
this is amazing . its a game that train our mind with fun not like other brain training games that only ask questions that are some time too annoying. it very fun and fast game in which you dont have to get into,1
excellent little puzzle game. cute simple graphics  with puzzles that appear simple but can be very challenging!,1
really good experience playing the game  feature to add levels and make one are good. and levels later really challenges you.,1
intricate and lovely sets  feel empathy when characters gets zapped  he has personality! like the puzzle  problem solving part  dexterity challenging for older new to gaming person. wonderful job dev's,1
the best game i've come across. lots of additional levels can be downloaded and you can create and publish your own levels.,1
this game is mind-relaxing  with mellow music and sounds. the graphics are picturesque  minimal ads and puzzles are well constructed with cute characters.,1
i actually don't like the zapper. the should be no size limitation in creating a level. i also don't like the red bot that you have push or help you out in level 19 and the red bot with a zapper head to get away with.,0
this is one of the few mobile games that are genuinely fun without trying to milk your wallet dry. it's fun and relaxing and has just the right level of difficulty. i love it!,1
this app was very exciting ang also you can release your stress. and i also recommend this game to children  because this app can make your children's learn a lot . thats why i rate this app 5 stars,1
it's a good game  some of the levels i got stuck on but i beat those levels. only one level i had to go on youtube for  and that was level 13.,1
i love this game! seriously  whenever i plays this game  my mind gets relaxed. its too much fun to play the game. and the best moment is when that robot falls from the building or whatever that is. i seriously like this game. the only best offline game available in the google play..,1
this is a very cute puzzle.. i'm so sad that it's only have 50 levels and if you want to play more you can visit their facebook to click the link where you can download some of levels.,1
it's an amazing experience playing this  the graphics  the details  the structuring and the puzzles everything is on perfect set with bg music ofcourse,1
the graphics all are good. but this game is more of a reflex training than an actual brain twisting puzzles game. gets boring after sometime.,0
the robot keeps falling because of the smallest pushes from the movable parts of the puzzles. gets kinda annoying when you're so close to finish and the little idiot can't even stand by itself.,0
amazing gmeplay   even runs smoothly in small phones   i love the graphics very much amd the music increases the concentration . so good to play when there is no network available,1
this game is awesome! even though it is difficult  it is still fun and mind helpingly great to play. something good that this game needs  is no wifi. i absolutely love that. please make more amazing games like this. please.,1
superb!! this gmae is quiet difficult. but some levels are easy. nice game  nice graphics and nice controls.,1
what can i say about this game? it's so perfect! i can feel all the love and dedication of the developer. can't find a single defect on it  it's completely perfect! congratulations is the minimum you deserve for this amazing piece of art! thanks a lot!!,1
the new ui could have been better. the bottom section (story  master cards  build and you )could have been shorter in height,0
ahh! making something difficult for majority doesn't mean a good game. very poor controls. good thing you can create your own puzzles freely.,0
get. this. game. already! it is simply the best puzzle game. mind blowing graphics  amazing controls. its great.,1
it's very interesting and a challenging gaming..... if they provide small instructions will be usefull....... but from my point of view its a wonderful game eargly waiting for part2,1
this game is very nice. it is really a tricky one. i think only the perfect and intelligent people can win each level in this game. i like this game. mekorama... its an awesome name! well everyone can download this. but only the genius can win!!! i this game!,1
fantastic puzzle game that is hard enough to keep you thinking but not so impossible that you want to throw your phone out the window. add nice music and a cute robot and you've got a very well made game.,1
i absolutely love this game  and so does my 5 yr old daughter. it can be very challenging at times  frustrating at others  but always fun to play. if you haven't tried it...you need to. it is a great way to pass the time.,1
this is good game. there are many different levels . starting levels are not hard but levels is up and levels is also hard.,1
it's a well made game with simple to difficult levels. from visuals to simple yet effective sound design works quite good. loved it.,1
super fun game  i can't put it down. it males you think and its really creative. i loke how you can make your own levels and share them with friends. definitely a great game and app.,1
excelsior... its different  unique  quite perfect indeed... the graphics are unexpectedly good  and the game itself is made excellent!! love it!!,1
the idea and the whole structure is very cute and simple. sometimes you just can't get the controls properly,0
it's good   but i see potential for this game cuz i think that it needs more materials more features like actual free camera movement like you could go like in there pov and like go into buildings and like pause while in mid play and much more but overall good game!,1
awesome game! i really liked the concept and the fact that this is a really good brain teaser. althoigh the controls might be a bit shaky sometimes its a must have game,1
man!!! it just makes me happy whenever i play it. best concept best visuals best graphics giving it for free is kinda donation you did for the whole world. cause if this game is not paid then i don't know which game should be paid.,1
loved the whole game but had to delete it because of one issue  i can't even see through the little lanes or hallways whatever you call it to analyse how i'd get out same with the levels with water i can't see down there so how do i know where to go?? it's like playing blindly..... please fix those  i love it and i'd love to download again.....,0
so l saw this game in another game made by the same person martin magni called fancade this guy is a genius every single bit of his games are simply amazing the soundtrack the controls the game itself it's just so well made and the idea of making these well made games free then maybe if you could and want you can pay some money to get small perks that won't affect the game,1
beautiful game! the graphics are fun and fluid. challenging  but not impossible ,1
your game is great and doesn't consume alot of storage space unlike other games.i am really confused of how you made the game so small and yet the graphics are so good.. you need to make more games like this.. its so awesome,1
i love it! this is what all games should be like. it works off-line too. it is soothing and you can make your own levels! if you like slow peaceful puzzle games then get it!,1
incrdible i dont know what to mention this game has a lot. light weight app  graphics  new concept  ui is awesome  techniques are unique.,1
some of the levels are impossible  because my device is not touchscreen so i cannot touch in two places at once  could you please make controlls where you can click and hold to change view instead of useing two fingers  because i cannot click in two places at once.,0
the best   the cutest and the most challenging puzzle game that i played. thanks for creating this game i am so immobilized by its cute theme   sounds and graphics   it is really addictive game that challenge may creativity .,1
i love this game  the background music isnt annoying  graphics are so clear  challenging game but the control is a little bit slow and hard sometimes,0
i love the visuals  everything in this game was just awesome. tho  i hope there would be a lot of levels to explore and solve. thanks.,1
absolutely love this game. enjoyed it so much i played it twice. the little robot is cute and some levels can be tricky and make you think. highly recommended.,1
i miss strategy games like this  fantastic graphics  hard but achievable levels  absolutely awesome game. how can i submit one of my designs?,1
the graphics is excellent. concept is good. bad that even a single hint is not available for free!,1
this game is amazing. after a long time i found a game which is worth playing. amazing work you did guys making this game. the developer is really generous and kind. levels are not that hard. plus  i really enjoyed playing it.,1
please give more levels. all levels are easy. there should be more hard levels. nice gameplay. i liked it very much.,1
absolutely stunning and challenging game  i love everything about it  the graphics  music and the smoothness is spot on  great job dev !,1
almost fun. the reliance on weird motions makes it unruly to play on a phone touch screen. too much tricky maneuvering not enough puzzle.,0
i dont like rating apps and writing reviews. but this game is so good i just had to say something. for a free game  it provides longevity by allowing other people to make and share their own puzzles. i love this feature. great game  mr. magni! kudos!,1
awesome game  simply awsome game in such little mbs. also you can make your own levels thats simply amazing. awesome graphics  smooth gameplay.,1
really goooood game could get a rating 9.9 out of 10 . and also request for a second part of it as there were very less levels. worth downloading .,1
the game's good but the further i progressed into the game  the inability to change the perspective so you're looking only at a single side of the cube bothers me more and more,0
brilliant game for a toddler! relaxing music and sounds  yet fun and logic thinking promoting game. cute and funny robot. this is a game i would happily have payed for for not having any in-app-purchase offers. the author has really thought through the levels he created. thank you!,1
loved it at the download size it comes. but overall graphics & the game presentation is very well managed . kudos to your team,1
might look childish for once but tends to get challenging  engaging  addictive while maintaining its simplicity card! must try..,1
it's a nice and simple game . you can even create your own levels and play them once you've finished the first in-game levels. i liked it very much.,1
such a fun game  has beautiful graphics and nice sounds. love the levels as they get more difficult the farther you get.,1
its a really great game!! it gets my brain to work and there are no ads!! as you progress it gets more challenging and more fun.,1
wow no ads. politely asks for a donation but you don't have too. hope some people do give donations as it is well deserved. great little puzzle game. challenging but fun also. and you can even create your own puzzles. 5 stars all day every day with games like this.,1
really loved this game. simple  but still challenging ,1
very good graphics and good sensibility. i really appreciate. if you can customize restart button  it will be great looking game.,0
awsome game. just 2 suggestions. can you add a bot where you can make a path that he follows. and can you make a settings menu for bots  mtors and zappers? it would spark so many more level ideas.,1
friends play it  one of the best challenging game in play store.sound concepts  levels of puzzles and everything are magnificent.5stars no doubt its worth,1
amazing and fun game.... well graphics... little more challenging and it can improve our thinking capacity. there are 50 levels and thousands of fan made levels. so interesting levels. super game. thanks to mr. martin mangi sir to give this amazing game to us.,1
very nice game with pleasing sound and simple mechanics and great graphics. also very tricky......and playable. don't have any in app purchase   best thing.,1
defiently one of the best puzzle games i've played. love the design and the physics are pretty good. so i give it around 4 stars looks great!,1
too much ads.. ads actively interupts gameplay  pauses game to show ads. ads in between levels are fine. but pausing an active level just to show ads is not acceptable.,0
hey martin  it's a great game for every age group. you can think  make strategy  enjoy and make your own stages. i made some children to play this game who were addicted to shooting/firings/fighting/racing games. it's better than them and doesn't spoil their mental health.,1
i love this app. it is really very amazing as it makes you feel fun and also exercise your brain. it is the only game which i love the most. good graphics  good control  good features and good game. simple game which anyone can play also this game is very addictive.,1
5 stars as its deserve best mind game actually it's innovative specially for architect and architect student in this game we don't only have to solve game but we can also make our own level so it's very very helpful; i appreciate the work and the efforts made by developer to make this game,1
it has many levels but when you get carried away  it's easy to finish the game early adds more interest if more levels are there,0
gets difficult. it's definitely challenging. frustrating at times but it's a good puzzler.,1
the best of the best puzzle game i have ever played. great graphics  great controls and that tiny robot is sooooo cute. it make my day. thanks martiny.,1
this is fantastic game. no such issues when i played this game. this is excellent idea made this type game.this game size is small but graphics is so sweet.it's true mekaroma is relaxing  mindbloing  puzzle solving only less than 5 mb. thanks for making this type of game.,1
this game is very interesting and hard if u dont know game mechnics.for example,1
outstanding game. the game is very good qith good graphics  nice puzzles  good apperance of game  etc. we can also creat our own levels and play in it. and that also make it owsome thankyou guys who made this but you should make another mokorama 2 game and really we all are waiting for it to come thankyou again..........,1
omg! amazing offline with lowest size... you can create your own levels and share it to your friends... you can play custom levels with a screenshot with it's qr code... it's funny and dificult also. try this app you will really like this one. this is an over rated app.,1
took a little while to get the focus on how the game was played. the best thing is there are little twists and variations in each game. still learning.,1
this game is just incredible.....so relaxing yet challenging ...a nice workout for brain ... i really liked it.... it's totally worth ... anyone who likes puzzles should try this game.,1
great game  very peaceful but you can't always see what you're doing which can sometimes get a bit annoying. i'm having fun but also a little trouble on a couple of them. all together it's a pretty good game,0
it's a amazing game good graphics hard levels i'm giving it a 4 star rating because the hints are almost always hard to understand if you could fix it i might give it a 5 star rating,1
great puzzles. realy stretches my brain. controls are a little difficult but that may just be my phone. love the little robot dude.,1
i really loved this game. i have completed all the levels. am waiting for part 2. if mekorama 2 is there  i will download definitely. i reffered to my friends about this game.. they also started playing... its a simple and decent game.,1
great game. great programming. some are really challenging like levels 19 & 22. characters elicit a smile watching the animations. i love the fact that donations are a simple ask. they deserve the donation for the superior work.,1
the puzzles are not rocket science  but the game offers some play through value and the graphics are very well put together.,1
i've been looking for good mobile games on the internet for quite sometime i saw this game on the suggestions everytime but i never bothered downloading it because i thought it would be boring then i downloaded it today and mannn am i loving this game! i really wish i could have payed some bucks for this game. i love it!!!,1
loved it  great piece of work  hadlots of fun playing it  spent many hours going through the puzzles and when i finally solved it  the feeling is awsome. must try,1
this sentence is coming from malay. kecil kecil cili api. it means it's a very good game although it was in a small download size. the problem is a roofed building with a blocker bot. i can't move much.,0
this game is a challenging puzzle try this one its massively cool and interesting game also i was happy that i can create levels without payments. thanks for creating this game.,1
fantastic game which pushes you to think.. somewhere you need to observe how things work and then strategise! excellent puzzles!,1
great puzzle game. really well designed. a good place to relax while still challenging your brain a bit.,1
the game was really good before the stars came in and the levels started being easy as heck  even a two year old kid could solve this  i prefered the game when it was harder  now it's just stright up trash,0
absoulutely loved this game. very addictive. i completed all the levels. the levels are really challenging. mind blowing game .,1
this game is a great time killer. the character is cute and the graphics are awesome. some puzzles are hard but not impossible.,1
i like this game a lot. it has a charming robot and we have to help him by completing each puzzle or level. u all should try fancade. it is also a good game. plzz... download this game and enjoy,1
nice game. i have problems though. my map cannot have a permanent solution. and i want a tutorial because i don't fully understand the game yet. i hope my problem gets fixed soon.,0
someone recommended this game for me   and i have been olaying it since then. it's a really good game that makes you think if your next step   the character is so cute and it's ime killing. love it!!.,1
the game is extremely awesome.some updates are needed for making this the best game i have ever played you guys should allow us to sign in for play games and should allow us to make our self made levels publicize. the conclusion is ; this game is aweso e but updates will make it the best.,1
this game is amazing! can i kill the red? just kidding. work more in rotations  adjust it. i find it hard because of the rotation. ,0
beautiful game. great art style. love the music. overall  this artistic indie game is amazing to play and even more fun to finish.,1
to be honest this game is really bland  the physics are wonky and the levels are super easy  it's practically pay to win since you can't use hints since the game just expects you to know everything about the mechanics of the game  really sloppy  i don't reccomend.,0
this game is great and used brain very good. every level i feel like i have a new brain challenge. not like most of the games repeat itself.,1
this is a must have app for all the puzzle and maze lovers  its very essential and my go to app to whenever i want to intellectually stimulate my brain. its an absolute time killer  not forgeting its soothing music and funny robots. well done martin.,1
i really enjoy the puzzles so far  they are engaging an even though they are fairly simple at the start (i'm by level 15) they're very entertaining.,1
i really love the game and it is very addicting. the flaw i see is that it is not only intelligence you need  but also motor and sensor abilities. this flaw is my personal view and should not be taken very serious,1
relaxing puzzle game! i love playing this game. the puzzles are challenging  but very fun. would definitely recommend downloading!,1
it's coolest game i have ever played man!!!! grophics r cool controls are sooo smooth and awesome levels . this game is soothing and so it's background music. this game make me think in a different way . devloper shoulf be praised.,1
nice game  ads not too overdone. level 39 master makers (red balls by el797)  i finally sunk all three balls after who knows how many tries  and the dang red bot walked on top of them then got stuck in that spot. couldn't climb out to the star. frustrating!,0
the robots are cute. the gameplay is smooth and very less ads. challenging  interesting and entertaining game. totally worth 5 stars.,1
i first played this gane 2 years ago and completed it... today i want to play it again.. i first start this first 2 levels were same just that stars collecting was new and it make game more interesting... and there are so many new levels i loved it...,1
i think this puzzle app is great   just a little bit more update   add more puzzle game into it and some qay i can be able to send my puzzle i created to a friend and let them solve them   i think thats a good idea right?,1
nice game but some levels are tough to solve can you give hint without any cost. afterall great game  we can make our own cards.,1
very entertaining! a little difficult on certain levels to tap where you need to  so i am stuck on a couple.,1
the concept is really good. the graphics is incredible. but most importantly it gets tougher and tougher and keeps you glued.,1
i'm knocking off a star due to constant harassment about paying the deveoper.other than that it's fun challenging  plenty of levels  and no ads is a plus.,1
this game is challenging  inquisitive  most of all ... fun!! i love the free-build feature. i've spent hours building different stages. i love this game.,1
super duper app i love it never bored play this game because there are many level we can get out there like search at google for qr code  sometime i feel stressed because that level to hard but it's not your fault  it's my brain that can't thinking to much anyway  love this app,1
when you're stressed af! it'll help you relax ! it's minimal design ! no ads! and cute graphics .great job. you feel satisfied when you complete each card. p.s please give some cute name to that robot like add a storyline or something,1
the best puzzle game i have ever played. literally i've fallen in love with this game. the music is amazing as well as relaxing  so is the sound. it deserves more than 5,1
wow! i usually am addicted to different strategic and online pvp battles but this game takes my experience to the whole new level. just few word from my side = absolutely amazing game = brilliant work from the developers. please keep on developing such games.,1
beautiful design  controls are smooth and the game itself is clever and offers you a nice play time. this a diorama puzzle game  a cute mix between captain toad and monument valley. i highly recommend mekorama  congratulations for this fine piece of work!,1
excellent ! this game is really fun . the puzzles are mind boggling but the graphics and picture quality is really cool . thanks for making such a game.,1
nice little game to challenge the grey matter. gets progressively hard. minimal ads. easy control. aesthetically pleasant. recommend it!,1
i personally like the game but please remove bug where the shadows of moving object stays just use draggables and stick it to ground the shadow is stilk there also please make the world bigger maybe you can build your thing without running out of space and also dont forget new wheels where u can move it with button also more smarter a.i pls cuz the ai is kind of an idiot here soo please fix ok ill love it!,0
awesome game! graphics are great  soundtrack isn't annoying  you can even create your own level!,1

mekorama is a wonderful lil' puzzle solving game with beautiful enriched graphics and a cute cast of robot characters. it's fun for all ages! i highly recommend this game. especially if you're a fan of the puzzle genre.,1
absolutely phrnomenal gaming experience. martin magni knows how to grip the gamer to the game. you get to do some light-heavy brain exercise and this game is has incredible graphics and interfaces. has been great to play and seeing the bot go in level 50 i felt really sad. thanks martin magni.,1
very interesting game..i already like {c}..i think he is quite a cute little robot and the music tone of the game is very soothing.i think everyone can play the game..they just need to be in the right mindset. thank you...although plz if u would just add more characters or more colour skins to the robot...thank u!!!,1
it's an unique 3d maze game where you can interact with the environment. also wonderful textures! 5 for the idea and gameplay. thank you developer!,1
i think it's a great game and i love the building aspect of the game one cing do i'll be better if it had a straight angle of view on top and from the side and illumination over all is great .,1
enjoyed every single level   it is really a 3d puzzle game different from the regular one found everywhere. amazing work hoping to see more similar themed games from you   amazing !,1
it is fantastic... really good theme and few levels require real intelligence... moreover it also helps you making your own leaves... really good game.....,1
lovely app to spend some time with in quarantine! i grew quite fond of the little fellows. heck  i even came to like the electro executioners. well done and very entertaining.,1
elders can play with little ones easily and yet its not too boring neither easy. each stage is a good challenge.,1
fun logical puzzles  great graphics  controls are very easy . fun for all to play. thanks!,1
interesting and engaging. most levels are easily completed once you get the hang of it.,1
great and wonderful. full of colors  music and interaction. great puzzles and easy for pasing some time.,1
it is good and all but can you please add maore maps because there are just 50 they are challenging but please add more but thanks for this game you could even build your own map..,0
first few levels were good  but later on we stuck at a point and there is no option of getting hints as well. we need to pay for the hints.... after paying you feel you are not satisfied with it....,0
the game play needs improvement. when you try to move the wheel the surrounding starts rotating. and the game is buggy. kindly fix this.,0
i love this game! there is an adventure in every new level and exciting. but the problem is the bot use to stuck in lvl 41. pls fix this. the bot can't enter the hole.,0
very intresting and fun to play also it helps us to build different types of level. not only these it helps to generate idea.,1
really good game ! i love it . the gameplay is also very nice . it is really a brain tester . i love making my own levels rather than playing the levels of this game . but it's still awsome !!! love it so much . thanks for making it,1
absolutely amazing!!! brilliant concept  superb graphics  addictive gameplay. best game for analytical reasoning and problem solving.,1
played this with my aunt when she was still alive. reminds me of the times when my aunt asks me for help whenever she gets stucked on a level. love this game because of that  and also because it's just a really darn good game overall.,1
i love this game  but getting qr codes in a bit tedious. i think it might be better if you could upload levels through the app  like fancade. please consider maybe? i would like to upload my own levels.,0
the sounds are relaxing and the game itself is like a fun brain training puzzle. great for passing time!!,1
everything is good untill........ dont worry i'm not gonna write some imperfection because this is perfectly perfect but the thing is that it become easy for me...i had completed all the levels in just 5 days so if u will pls add some more level in it then this app will become worth again for me,0
breathtaking. most amazing puzzle game i haver ever played in my life. most amazing levels this game is the integrity of some of the best developers in the world. very well done guys.,1
it is a nice game worth giving a try. graphics and controls are awesome wiith trickier levels and mind consuming play strategy.,1
excellent game. no ad s. bug free. clean application super smooth game play is nice with excellent graphics. i am happy. i like the game as l progress.,1
loved it!! absolutely delightful. clean ui  no ads  pay as you want  beautiful music. great work all in all. happy playing ,1
aggressive ads. it put ads even before the game saved the progress  with different device setting  it will reset the game after the ads  that needs you to redo the supposedly solved puzzle.,0
really good game with really creative puzzles that always keeps you engaged and doesnot forces itself to be a difficult puzzle game but rather a clever puzzle game.,1
brilliant game! loving the absence of ads!! finally a game with great graphics that is genuinely puzzling & enjoyable. developers - i salute you!,1
this is a amazing puzzle game(cute bots  nice graphics  soothing background music) that you not only play but you can also make your own mekorama levels & you can also post your levels in mekorama forum website... (it makes me feel happy ,1
robot is adorable. very interesting and challenging logic game. no glitches. very enjoyable and quite addictive. love it.,1
the game's pretty neat but with the touch controls can be a bit hard to pin point where you want your character to go.,0
it is a great game with different level and the best thing is that we can make our own levels and it is too cheap also it is the best puzzle game i have ever played. i loved it,1
it is a very good game under 20 mb   high quality graphic good control systems but some glitches are there 1. in few cases robo was dont go where i locate . 2. in coustom i dont make 2 yellow robo(it is not a bug),0
excellent for the whole family. no ads  no annoying music or interruptions  no hidden purchases for my kids to avoid. a polite option to support the developer. all kid-friendly aps should be like this!!,1
it is excellent in every way. controls are not frustrating and for a graphics like that it should not be free,0
it's a totally mind blowing game . so good graphics and controls and also very challenging levels. i love this game very much.,1
hello dear martin first i have to thank you for a such a wonderful game... and i really likes the way u did... no annoying ads.. and the payment method its big change from the others... i paid what i can now... i hope in the future i will pay little bit more.. honestly ur work deserves that... we looking more games and apps like this.. huge thumbs up for u....,1
i played this game when it first came out and the community then  and since has always been wonderful. it's a quick little solo play puzzle game with innovative features  and when you get into the community levels it'll only get better.,1
we can't afford the game  but i promise if we had the money i would definitely buy it for my 5 yo severe autistic grandson.. this is one of his favorite games... not sure if he's playing correctly but he can build his little honey off...,1
there is a problem in seeing the whole dimension because of that i have to play some level by just plain assumption. like in level 9 temple of athena. you must add a full maneuverability of the whole scene in that level otherwise there will be a whole lot of assumption,0
it's a really simple and extremely polished puzzle game  and when you finish with the main ones  the community has you covered definitely recommended,1
game is truly challenging and mind boggling but level 41 is not working.. please fix it as soon as possible because i want to end this challenging game.,0
its a very good game. pritty clean. i spend most of my time making levels for my friends. my only problem is the small amount of levels.,1
the game is basically unplayable. it wouldn't register when i tapped the screen except for the pause button  and even then  that only worked a few times.,0
this is a truly enjoyable game. it is adventurous and causes one to use one's mind. this game seems to improve one's mental ability to solve problems and improve one's understanding and patience.,1
great little app packed with awesome levels this deserves a 11/10. the only issue i have is with the camera angle  at some points i can't see jack *  but it works. thanks for an awesome game,1
first of all adorable character  second it's fun entertaining unpredictable mentally challenging but not stressful and overall a good brain teaser. i recommend this game to anybody.,1
awesomeness  i am in search for such game. will surely purchase. currently in amidst of corona epidemic. let me start earning again. until then thanks. the in game sound is very soothing as well the game play. not typical puzzle game rather fluid.,1
most innovative and out of the mainstream game ili have ever played. a must for both puzzle solvers and creators. this is such a treat.,1
i like the little character. its movements are realistic enough to generate a surprising amount of empathy. some of the solutions are tough  and some surprising. i love that.,1
the best things in life are unexpected  this game is one of them  no ads  flawless gameplay and great levels.,1
this is the type of game that goes unnoticed when it shouldn't! it is so awesome - it's one of the best games i've ever played and downloaded on my device - that i've literally played for so long i don't even notice the time passing. definitely must download!,1
love these types of games. gotta use your brain to get thru the levels. nice job! no ads is the best part of it all. they are soooo irritating. thanks!,1
its a very intresting game made for genius... those who things he/she is a genius can try this game... but i'm sure that he/she can't complete 25 level.... so its my recommendation to try this game and those who going to try this game best of luck....,1
i can't say anything negative... really. i love how quirky and fun it is. i get flustered each time i try a new level. some of the puzzles remind me of the stuff from alundra or wild arms back in the day... whooooheeee what a ride!,1
a vefy immersive experience and best game for mental exercises. every level have different logic and a different experience.,1
this is an incredible puzzle game with lots of fun puzzles though a few rely on reflexes instead of puzzle solving and one is puzzle is just wrong the rest just pure fun to figure out,1
its fun. i absolutely love how cute the robot is. the puzzles are really good too.thy make you think. i can't not leave a review after getting to level 22,1
i haven't had such an engrossing game since lemmings. graphics and controls are simple but brilliant.,1
i like this game . it is so relaxing and one of the bests for time pass. it also helps you think. graphics are also so good. i play this game when im bored and it helps me refresh.,1
i absolutely love games that present a bit of a challenge  have great graphics  and logic in the gameplay... this game has it all!! *****,1
this game shows everyone how even a silly mission to reach a spot by a cute little robot can be so interesting. looking forward to more versions ,1
i just finished all the level in less than 12 hours without hint (maybe because the covid19 at my country and yeah you know the conditions) and i enjoy the game. no ads but you must donate first to use hint and sometimes the app ask you for a donation. it's just fine for me.,1
it's the best puzzle game ever. i love this game so much thanks martin for making this game. i have completed the game. it was so tricky .50 levels and waiting for next update.,1
it's an awesome game . i like spending time on playing it   but the only fear i have is that what will i do when all levels will be completed . i request the developers to create more versions of this game . thanks for reading !,1
i love this game. simple yet hard  challenging but relaxing. i love making my own levels and trying other peoples levels. if i had money  i would donate some. 10/10 totally recommend,1
great app  great graphics  awesome gameplay one can enjoy it without paying anything. no ads make it must try. i would like to have more games like this. i appreatiate. i support,1
at first i thought it was a simple puzzle game with wonky game physics. now i know why  since it will later be a part of another puzzle. brilliant.,1
i love this game very much  it helps you think smarter in a way... i also love that this game takes up less space and also works offline while providing such amazing animation and design,1
the game has a good ramp in difficulty. controls are simple. graphics are great. really enhoy this game,1
absolutely fantastic game.you can create your own levels or complete challenging levels. it is a good game for mind development.,1
a really fun and well designed game... no lags  no glitches  no crashes  etc...great for all age groups.,1
i have played lots of mystery solving games but this one is the best of all and the size of the game was also too low. i enjoy playing this game. best time passing game with increasing the iq level,1
mekorama is a calming game. i use it to help me with feelings of anxiety or depression. it's a unique little platformer/puzzle game and i think if you give it a try  you might enjoy it. have a nice day ,1
just had a great but sometimes frustrating time but mekorama is just the perfect low storage game with great graphics and neat gameplay.,1
very intresting game  its one of the best maze games i have ever played. it elevates u like while playing rusty lake games   just that its a lot more easier and nice. i hope the developer would soon add more interesting levels to the game soon,1
good game concept. pathetic character control. the character moves like a drunkard. you never know which path he would take to reach destination point.,1
this is the third time i'm installing this cute game. never bored with it. quite challenging and mind cracking. have always loved these kind of puzzles....keep it up martin! thanks!,1
awesome and real tricky game. its real tough to cross levels after completing 25th level. i suffered a lot and had lots of fun in this game amd even we can create levels i thats what i like more in this game.thank u martin for creatimg such a beautiful game,1
d ,1
great alternative to monument valley. fun puzzles and interesting solutions. controls sometimes elusive  but great game and cute robot!,1
very brilliant game in such at low space 3d graphic   puzzle   ect keep it better than now in future and add multiplayer in it so we can enjoy with our friends.....,1
i do enjoy the style and gameplay  but stopped playing after a while since it got frustrating and annoying after a while.,1
what a cute game with delightful animation and really makes you think to solve spatial puzzles! very well designed!!,1
i really like this game.this game is really addictive. difficult to cross some levels but i love a concept of this game. where i can design my own level and i can play levels created by people. this game never ends,1
pure pleasure. fun and logical game  free but no commercial. feels a bit retro. i have not see better and more honest game in years. i will go give donation to developer now. get a game and then be a nice person - pay.,1
it's a great game for thinkers and puzzle solvers and who will play just for fun so i fully support this game so if u want to install this game it's great u can installl! i m so proud that to tell i completed all the levels exept the 49th level it's really worst traffic note ,1
awesome sensibilities and aesthetics. magni really gets the sense of toying associated with puzzle games. love the level editor as well.,1
ok good good game but i have 2 big problem aout this game ,1
it's somuch fun and relaxing and those puzzles are so beautiful especially the ability to make your own map ... i think i wont uninstall it forever.,1
it's a nice mind blowing puzzle game and i like ut very much. makes us to think in a different way to solve each puzzle.,1
it's really cute i loved the puzzle they are easy and you can further levels without paying too which is rare to find across in games these days.,1
this is a very nice game  it has nice graphics  interesting puzzles and all that in 4.3 mb. honestly it's the best puzzle game i have ever played.,1
tricky but fun. love the look of the puzzles  robot is so cute plus the pay what you can or write a review for a free hint. thst is a great idea. recommend this to try.,1
there are a million games in play store. but this one is so special and unique. my friends often got bored of any games play. until this one came along. its a must try for all ages. you will go nuts in somelevel. totally worth it.,1
it's a creative game with a very cute little robot for which we have to clear the maze and with very interactive design . thinking and fun  ideal for children.,1
this game is f..n awesome.level 14 convinced me that its more than a game the strategy you use in level 14 would be enough to ensure your iq is above 100.it didnt take me more than 10min to get the strategy and feel proud to cross that stupid friend!!moreover this game is the best of best in only 5mb.just look at the game the graphics and animations.....and especially the puzzles are by far too awesome.this game would improve your iq if you play it.i apreciate the developers as well for d game,1
i am just confused. i already donated some cash to this app with this same google account. i uninstalled it ang changed my phone then re-installed it. now its asking me to donate again? hmmm sketchy. good game though. perfect for passing the time while making ur brain work.,0
overall an amazing app. very fun to play  stuff gets harder everytime and makes it fun and challenging to play. deffinetly would recommend.,1
i love the style and idea of this game  but the level design is just boring and atrocious. who though an uncontrollable guy who just functions to walk back and forwards to slow you down was a good idea?,0
i love puzzle games like this  and this game deserves 5/5 the controls are easy to understand and the colorful graphics makes this a great game,1
this game great. but they make no allowances for people who have not only paid for the game but even paid more than they were asking for. i guess they are only interested in collecting money no matter how they get it. no matter how many times they charge you. money grubbers,0
the best game which opens our brain and let us remember every proverb. like where there's a will there is a way!really awesome game. everybody try it who are not so intelligent also try it.it will increase ur iq.it teaches us to keep our brain calm and cool.i am proud that there is such intelligent person to create this game.please play the game.,1
good brain challenge. nice game. if you could make with a treasure hunt or some sort of adventure it would be better.,1
so far it's very fun but the way you get hints is annoying to a extent. other than this it's been challenging but fun.,1
i think there was a problem,0
"a refreshing game with a really cool ""card"" system where each level is stored on a card. you can make levels and then share the card with your friend. and you can collect cards from your friends.",1
not addictive  but perfect for playing for short time. i hate games which makes u feel so addictive and cannot do any other work. this game helps me relax inbetween work!,1
great little puzzle game  love the physic mechanics used. only just started the game today  hence not full 5 stars. will need to get further into the game.,1
this is my all time favourite game. i completed the game many times and i always have this with me. the music the robo the structure the levels the eye of robo everything every single thing is best.,1
it is challenging and more interesting to solve it..now i'm getting addicted to it.. just loved the game   such an amazing graphics ! ,1
this game is mindblowing amazing and fantastic. this game needs very intelligent mind that can clear the stages. this makes good understanding and it contains so many difficult riddeles. thanks for reading my opinion.,1
very interesting and mind twisting solving game that is great to exercise the brain to think for the way out. loving it and supporting all the games that are like this.,1
much interesting and brain killer game. many stages take up much brain to solve. many forced me to watch solution on youtube. but overall is nice. i am waiting for stages updates. i have cleared all,1
very fun and challenging game. gets you thinking but isn't impossible. seldom ads and fun  unique levels.,1
its a brilliant game with crazy details and puzzle if you have a amoled or oled display it looks so much sharp you can't believe this its only 5-6 mb   if i could i would pay for the game   download the game and if you can please donate something thank you.,1
good game and very much interesting. i have some suggestions 1.you can make more levels built in game 2.you can add more blocks on build section and on the game also 3.you can add new window called online in which players can download play and share the puzzles made by them thank you for reading and hope that will help.,0
i absolutely love this game  it's filling my game void from finishing tiny robots which i loved too. this is great  i keep looking to see how many i have left. i'm about half way thru. make more pleeeease!,1
it's a really fun game with a cute  little robot  and it even has a level editor. however  the level editor is kinda hard to use.,0
i seriously am in love with this game. great time killer too! i love the challenges that each level gives you. it starts super easy so even my little cousins can enjoy this.,1
good game in very less storage..and there are many kind of puzzles and you can create your own puzzle or level..and it is a offline game.,1
complete with lots of levels  smooth graphics  fitting music  and even a level maker  all under 5 mb! if i could donate i would!,1
it's extremely cool  relaxing and tricky game. you'll fall in love with the character. it's extremely cute  all your stress vanishes with it.,1
i am giving one star because of ad's they fall between the game and our focus on it gets over . good game but craches also i have 4 gb ram but it lacks in game playing. i am a youtuber i wants to play the game which don't lage and crash between playing it . graphics is good but as a youtuber i wants to play game without ad break .,0
totally awesome keeps you thinking. it looks very easy but i think it's more eye coordination because at anytime you can fall it really is worth a donation keep up the good work and yes this grandmother gives you the ultimate two thumbs up,1
i think it's an amazing game! from the music and the sounds it records after u move the character is genius! very therapeutic btw.,1
amazing bro martin . u have given great feel to us. if it can be changed to in to action game . it will break all records. graphics and themes are out of the box. alot of love.,1
beautifully crafted visuals and creative use of screen space. simple but joyful adventure puzzle game.,1
its fantastic  just incredible.. i will recommend it to you.. instead of that rubbish 2-3 gb games.. its just 5 mb.. how the hell on this earth that is possible but martin did it.. hats off to you bro... incredible programming.. incredible script.. i feel i was in some other planet... rescuing my bot...,1
simple and great. good brain teaser. i completed 10 levels still i didn't use the hint option. good time killer and boost up your thinking,1
this game is so much fun and very addicting  it is like a puzzle for your brain and i love how the levels are in different areas of the world. 5 stars!!!,1
cool graphics  the puzzles are to hard for this dumb-dumb  but in a good way. control is smooth. mike,1
oh  what a game! how could you fit this huge game only in 2.5mb??!! unbelievable! everyone should play this awesome game. cause  it has no limit! just build your own levels and challenge your friends!,1
it's been fun playing out tricky puzzles. really addictive and was just hoping for few more levels but overall was awesome to play.,1
amazing.. my favorite puzzle game of 2020. i applaud your creativity  how you generate the music from the players movement is very impressive. great game.,1
the whole game is just awesome. at the beginning it looks very easy  but they get harder and harder. one of the best games i played. ever,1
it's great!! nice graphics  cool interface. easily one of the best 3d puzzle games i've played.,1
fun little game with a variety of puzzles to get your mind working. the art style is nice and the music is relaxing.,1
"this is such an amazing game to play ! i loved it the day i downloaded it   i didn't think it was a good game at first but when i saw the number of levels and the ""create your own levels""   i was glad i took a look at this game . 5 stars   wish i could do more but google play isn't letting me . i recommend everyone to try this game.",1
"wow! this is the ultimate brain booster puzzle!!! yet not boring and has good graphics. helps you thiiink and improve your mental ability. thanks to martin magni for ""mekorama"".",1
fantastic game  well thought out and looks amazing. well worth a look and one i'll happily play for hours the level editor is such a good addition.... not used it yet as i've only just discovered it. 5/5 for mekorama,1
this is really a master piece a good graphics 3d puzzle game where we can make our own level also i recommend everyone to play this game when they feel to do some brain exercise 5 star for this .,1
very interesting puzzles. graphics is good. all the levels are different in their own ways.,1
puzzles are mostly trivial... the challenge is the ui and visibility. you will get nautous after a while rotating the 3d models over and over trying to make out some path. sound is also horrible  apparently by design to make you feel immersed with zappy robot.,0
it's a very good game.... i love it a lot. when i played it first time i thought that this is boaring... after completing 6th level i found it more interesting... i was so curious to reach the end.. and i won the game,1
needs lot of patience and control to this game . simple  charming but brain-challenging game. completed all the levels.,1
nice puzzles in the games.i liked the game but i need some improvement in the game. that is when we make our levels there is limited world size. please make the world size very big. please!!!!. althrough nice game and puzzles.,1
excellent game... the art the level design  the character animations- it's brilliant.a very satisfying game to play.,1
this puzzle game is amazing! sometimes i get frustrated with some of the levels  but that is the main purpose of the game. rest of the stuff is great ! i really recommend this game,1
cute graphics. simple but challenging gameplay. not for those who don't have much patients.,1
very challenging but rewarding to finish that one pesky level. no ads. pay what you'd like.,1
i've wanted an app that i could make fun game levels with but not have to do too much programming. this app lets you do that with ease.,1
- ayush wadile ,0
fun puzzling game amd kinda funny too. i wish the camera to look aorund the puzzle was not locked in 90 degree intervals but free orbit. other than that its a great game,1
ok simple best graphic game. but there is no more cards. and also i needed some more robo character. thank you for this wonderful game. i like it. i have shared to my friends this game.,1
game is ok. puzzles are quite easy and doable. the real challenge is to fight the unprecise cumbersome tap/drag system.,0
the developer keeps begging you for money. there is also a rare bug where if 2 npcs get to a corner at the same time from 2 sides they keep headbanging each other and get stuck not being able to progress their ways which forces you to restart the level,0
very very good work. love the concept and love the game overall. graphics and movements are great.,1
awesome! i would definitely pay you for the game  but i can't right now. i don't know if it is my emulator or what  but the game music is so distorted it even sounds eerie. do you have an idea about what could have happened?,1
i love this cute mekorama. the way this robot walk is so funny. awesome game and superb graphics!!! plus it doesn't ask you to pay for anything. you can pay as much as you want. please make more games like this,1
it's very good but some confusen have in this game.robot is very funny control is good but not fully move what i want and one more thing is good that we can zoom.i do not see this game before. very good game but not for children please download it. good mind free game.,1
i love this game but can you make it so we can see everything because sometimes it super annoying when i have to go somewhere i cant even see but other than that amazing game with no adds,0
absolutely loved it!!!! great game  new concepts are introduced slowly so you get used to it. can play without internet. made my nights. thank you! love love love!,1
pretty fun  but annoying and tedious at times. also the message asking for donations every time you do something gets very annoying.,0
hints should be given for some levels instead of pay and take method. otherwise it becomes too tough for clearing some levels like lv 19 robo valley . coming to game it is the best game i have ever seen from my childhood under 10 mb,0
addicting with great graphics. wish the image could be rotated to any position rather than predetermined spots.,0
an undo and redo button would be nice and it would be nice to keep the field straight rather than being in isometric.,0
a great game but the 'make your own level' feature could do with some work. other than that  the game's splendid.,1
this app is awesome 1. it has a very low size and can run on any device 2. graphics are good as this game is low size 3. levels are challenging and good overall 5 star experience,1
it is good puzzle game and its graphics is nice. it is a very tricky game and we wnt to burn our heads in the harder level to solve the puzzle,1
great design with some cool levels. though some are borderline unplayable and the controls are finicky,0
it's a great game. pretty hard to complete (i'm stuck on 2 levels) i love they way it quantizes your moves into a tune.,1
very nice game.the little robot is so adorable. it walks like a toddler. the game starts with easy levels but gradually it gets hard which will make you think,1
good game  too many ads. when they say occasional ad they mean after each level. yes they are short ads but very repetative,0
i dig this game! relaxing 3-d puzzles with a tiny robot. no issues so far so thanks for a simple yet entertaining game.,1
engaging puzzles that make you expand your problem solving skills. giving 5 stars no bugs so far and every level is better than the last.,1
i could have given more than 5 stars as the game has even more fun as compared to its size.i really appreciate the developer to make this game which also includes a bit of brain exercise. moreover this game is offline and add free!!,1
very challenging. but everyone must try this one. needs lot of brain work . anyway i love it . well done developers . i like the movements of that little buddy .,1
meh! didn't find it too interesting. i mean there's only one spot the robot can ever move to  so you just keep clicking on different locations and eventually you click on the right one and he goes there.,0
amazing little puzzle game with the cutest tiny robot you've ever seen..... but why can my granddaughter clear levels in seconds when it takes me hours??!!! lol!!,1
xoxo i love this game the little robot is so cute .at first it was easy but now it getting a bit challenging in every level but anyways it's a really fun game to play.good job to the developers. and to you who is reading this review download this game it's worth it,1
truly good game difficulty increase at every level new way and new concepts to solve puzzles truly loved this game i hope developer will create part 2 for this with better puzzles and new concept great effort by martin magni hope so in future we will see a better popular game by you,1
nice game. makes us think. logical and interactive. simplistic music and very good graphics.,1
this was a very enjoyable experience. it really engages your brain. i found my self at 3am in te morning trying to find a solution to a puzzle. to the developers;well done,1
the best detailed mobile game that's very fun and has interesting puzzles all of which r simple yet if u do not look at it properly u will be stuck. in all its a very good game that deserves more than a 5 star review,1
this is a tricky game where you have to play 50 level by level a smart person can solve these puzzle. puzzle is not so hard but this game can change your mind set . i think you have to try this game,1
totally new concept  mesmerising graphics and negligible size make it a must- play. requires decent iq.,1
wonder full puzzle game. all the levels in the game are awesome. best part is players can build their own puzzle.,1
"amazing little puzzle game. it's awesome what someone can create with ""simple"". great game! i love it!",1
mekorama is addictive game for me. but it's to hard when there is no hints  please improve this game.. maybe free hints or every pass level we will get hints.. just my opinion.. thank you..,1
it's a really good puzzle and everything is completely free. you can only pay if you want to support the developer. respect,1
even the game is simple. the cute graphic and puzzle are interesting to play and spend the leisure time.,1
i think that every one should play this game it's a mind catching game we have to search way for reaching end point we can make our own level and we can play it even though if our level is ok by the game maker every one can play it .so at last i want to say that every one should play makoramaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,1
love this game! i had this game in the past .i have a galaxy note 10 and for what ever reason the game is not playing on a full screen. if anyone can help with this issue  i would greatly appreciate it. thanks for your time!,1
i'll ive been searching for this game in years  i kept typing nekorama thinking it was the name of the game but turns out one letter could make a large difference  it's because of my misspelling that i couldn't find this game.,1
i like it cuz it has some really challenging levels and its fun and the graphics are really nice too .. the music choice is soothing as well,1
best puzzle game ever with low download size  excellent graphics  good controls .... i love everything about this game ... i appreciate you martin magni for your work and keep it going ...,1
this game is fiendishly clever. the puzzles are a frustrating challenge that are hard to put down. the app is well thought out and executed.,1
thanx to developer. being of only 5 mb  it is very good game and editors choice also .best thing of this game is that  we can create levels. and i love the bacground music too.,1
very good game. it increases our level to think and solve very hard and interesting levels. may the most people should play this game.,1
love the game deserves 5 stars. the controls arent smooth but i think it is like that so that the game is challenging...,1
controls are wonky. often doesn't do what i want it to. overall just a frustrating experience.,0
nice puzzles and graphics is also amazing. like the concept where one can create their own puzzle. ,1
i absolutely loved this game and even if you have finished the story mode game then you can go to master and play the other people's map and the best thing is i can build my own map but i had a doubt after i make the map will other people be able to see and play my map  can the creator of this game answer my doubt?,1
its a cute game with good challenges. i have so far found them not too tough which suits my appetite and the stages i finished didnt take a lot of time so the game seems to be an excellent time pass,1
brilliant creation by a solo developer. @martin magni  you really inspired me to think out of the box. spent money for the first time on any app. giving 5 stars  keep up the good work!!! consider it as a little reward from my side to worth your efforts and admiration on your talent of creation.,1
nice game. best in free time. if you think levels are hard...no problem you can create your own level. 10 000 thanks to martin mangi and team,1
i loved the game too much. martin magni has made the best logical game. the levels are difficult and make much fun. and yes  the character is too cute. thanks martin magni..,1
i really like the game! its really cool and challenging!! but now i created my own game and i want to send this to martin magni! so that he/she can play my game the he will add it to the main levels.... so that mekorama will grow further!,1
adorable game  nice cute character. ever expanding and logical game. easiest way to get new levels. would like to 3000 stars but here only 5 are available.,1
it's refreshing to see a free game of this quality completely 100 percent ad free!! because there wasn't the annoyance of ads i donated $4 to the creator! thank you! great game!,1
great game for relaxing just download and try it you won't regret it. i love it and the fact that you can make your own levels and play other people's levels just adds so much more to it. one of the best games for your phone.,1
pretty good game  it's just that later levels are more of rinse and repeat till it works instead of actual puzzles.,0
it was a good thought provoking game that can make a person think in many ways it is one of the great game i downloaded every games don't impress me so fast it was a great experience with mekaroma thank you so much for a good gaming experience,1
it is a very interesting game in low mb for the person who really like to solve problems and puzzles. this game has a lot of fun  every level has an interesting problem and twists. the best feature of this game is that we can also make levels in this game. i have seen a lot of games but it is most interesting. loved tooo much . i want to rate it more than 5 stars but i can't so,1
amazing and addictive. interesting puzzles will capture young and old alike. i don't have many games on my device but this is staying!,1
i really like this game  it's simple and has cool graphics! it would be cool if the camera rotation was more flexible tho!,1
this is a out the box puzzle game  hay what can i say life is a little puzzling sometime this game can be very helpful to help you use the mind (whats in your thinking skills set) this is the game to get if you enjoy puzzles & rpg's,1
this game is so cute addictive and funnn!!! yey  i really like this game. every levels are exciting and thrilling and plus the mini robot is cute! thanks for creating this fantastic game! i highly recommend it to everyone;),1
lovely game but a shame purchases to go ad free can't be added to the family library. i'd rather pay a bit more for one hit for the whole household than have to pay per person.,0
this is a beautiful relaxing game. it's puzzling and challenging and at the same time incredibly calming and easy going. love the music  love the game.,0
superb game. i like this game very much. please send new updates to our brilliant players. i already finished master levels upto 35 levels. i didn't get any new updates from now. please send new updates.,1
awesome game! the robots are so cute! and the puzzles are hard enough to be challenging but not too hard to get past,1
this was a fun game  a lot like monument valley  i'm always looking for games similar to that. only 4 stars because the popups asking to financially support the dev got really annoying.,0
this is good game but some levels cannot be cross. there was a mistake in those levels.  30 and 19 level can't be cross,0
the game is mind numbing with a little challenge to it which is good. badgering for donations constantly to pay for the game is irritating. charge for the game or quite asking...the last update was in may 2016.,0
like it a lot  graphics are fluid and the little bod has a lovely movement. i will pay money maybe when i have played more.,1
great game... i've got only one problem the game needs a view of looking through the doors in the game and needs an aerial view... other than that the game is just awesome!!!,1
it's really a great game  it has great graphics  good levels  cute robot and believe it or not... free. amazing.,1
i completed the game...i felt like it finished very soon.hope you guys will add more levels. more interest obstacles that make the game a little more tough.. good luck guys..,1
this game is so awesome that it can even open the brain of a dull man! its very interesting n children must play it for their iq test. its an offline game n i request the developer of the game to make more levels. thank u,1
"amazing game.. with amazing levels .. thanks ""martin"" for making such a lovely game.. i wish to play many more such exiting games.. and also waiting for new version of mekorama.. sorry.. because i can't contribute enough but.. whatever i paid all for this lovely creation..",1
"favorite game ever.. i played it 3 years ago.. and now i am reinstalling it for a second run.. its only 5 mb  that is the best part.. please make more games like this... why the game has no updates since 2016 ?? ""odd bot out"" too was an amazing game..",1
excellent game  so entertaining  well worth the 3.99 for the premium  the ads just got a little annoying.,0
the best game i have played. great concept. easy game controls. great level difficulty implementation,1
that's the game everyone is looking for.anyone can play this and it's so relaxing to play it there is no need to stree out to complete a level and there is no need for frustration in it.i love it and expecting more levels from it,1
is very cool and satisfactory the music but there's a glitch in the game is in level 11 because if you do something wrong you get out of the puzzle.,0
very nice game i m bored and then i make my levels example mini golf robots home and etc. but that levels that make me have much time . please give a update and give mekorama chapter 2 . and more levels too . martin magni mekorama is the best puzzle game ever,1
great game  high graphics and very enjoyable! you can even make your own card(puzzle/level) the developer in this game i could say to you is that this game you've made is really awesome! great job!,1
the game is exceptionally well done  the challenge of figuring out the next move due to the camera angles is a lot of fun.,1
superb game...a simple but effective game to refresh and sharpen your brain simultaniously...also it comes with a remarkeble small size  that helps every smartphone user to save their memory space...,1
quite amazingly puzzled. good beautiful graphics. easy to play but grows more interest with difficulties.,1
too cute. don't let the static picture fool you into thinking this is some low functioning low resolution game. it's not. it is smooth and detailed.,1
"it was bery addictive.... even sometimes i want to throw my phone because its difficulty. i love the music effects  the animation  and the robot is so cute!. can you tell me why the robot's costume had letter""b""?",1
this game stretched my mind to its limits exploring the deepest caverns of my knowledge. thank you martin magni!!! i love playing because it doesnt need wifi or internet connection because of this i can play anywhere anytime!!!!!,1
this game is insane!! it is pretty good soo far  i like the graphics and all the levels are excellent. the level making section makes the game more interesting love it!,1
the game is really fun and challenging at times. the smooth controls and transitions are really good.,1
really nice game. smooth graphics  increasingly challenging 3d puzzles  satisfying gameplay. just really enjoying this,1
huge respect. the game is just so smooth and relaxing  gameplay is original and flexible. nothing to complain  one of the best. just a question,1
everything is fine except the music and sound effects are stuttery  it's messy but it's not really affecting the gameplay,1
simple  but deceptive. entirely frustrating at some points  but overall a good game. really nice graphics,1
it's an addictive game  very good for brain exercises. it challenges you to be able to think which is pretty awesome...,1
i never go out in my own and quite a review with out being promoted  so take my word,1
good puzzle game.best thing is you can create your own levels. if i would be able i would pay the highest buget available. this is my favourite puzzle game so far.keep going!,1
excellent puzzle game. high quality graphics and a new take on the puzzle style. highly recommended.,1
good game at such low storage nice strategy!! have to use your mind to complete the level which makes you more intelligent in problem solving.,1
i'm 88 and i'm absolutely hooked on mekorama now i've been into gaming all my life i even had a video and computer game shop and this is without doubt the best game i've ever played you keep going back to it thinking i will work that out which is proof of a really great game programme is just brilliant thank you so much keep up the good work len williams in gillingham kent 26.8.21the only thing i keep trying to buy the other levels hints etc but i don't know why it wont accept my visa card sorry,0
such a great game always makes me feel happy when i play it.the app even though being free contains no adds what so ever.the game almost feels neverending as levels get harder as you complete more levels thank you mr.martin magni for making this wonderfull game.....more soundtracks would boost the experience.,1
this game is just brilliant. simple graphics and simple controls. it's different from the other games i have played because this is a simple game that makes you play it over and over again.,1
its a very innovative game though it doesnt look such from an external peek. you would be amazed by how many different unorthodox kinds of paths would be the solutions,1
amazed ! truly amazed by the simple yet authentic seign of the gameplay and each puzzle is actually a quality puzzle to be solved !and believe me i enjoyed ot so much that i have actually complted those 50 card levels more than 3to 4times! congo to the developer for developing such intricate and unique game!,1
it's an awesome  complex thinking game that i had an extremely enjoyably experience playing  definitely recommend it to all that have a hunger for uniform puzzle games,1
the game itself is very enjoyable and the music used in it is really suitable and awesome! playing mekorama is an amazing experience which makes me so happy! thank you for creating this beautiful experience by working on such a game!,1
excellent graphics  nice interface  feeling good all the time  ajd background music is good too..,1
high quality graphics are very rare to find in such a small-sized game. hats off to the developers. please keep creating more games like this.,1
a great game under 10mb. it is totally enjoyable and funny. one can pass his/her time by playing it .one also can make his/her own level too. i like this game most.....,1
a very fun puzzler for all ages. my 5 year old loves this game as much as i do  and builds some pretty complex puzzles.,1
a fun game that takes little memory and there are no ads. not completed yet but it is pretty simple.,1
i love it  its a great puzzle solving game and really gets you thinking and with the make your own level aspect the game is unending,1
this game is actually super fun and peaceful to play. the music is very smoothing and very relaxing. if your looking for something to relax you this is your game.,1
progressive in each level  design is quite unique and if you're into solving challenging puzzles  this is it,1
this game was beautifull simple gameplay  good graphics yet challenging. no disturbing advertisement.,1
one main thing i luv about this game is the smoothness of it. the flow of it makes it soo satisfying to play. the game concept is just outstanding. amazing  yet underated,1
i like the game so much. i love it and it is interesting when making levels by myself. good game. please make the map size unlimited so that we can make a world ..,1
this is the game i was looking for.. it's fun and hard at the same time. more than doing the same thing again and again it helps to think in different perspectives.and i'm adicted to the game now...,1
really liked the game with simple graphics  brain challenging puzzles and really cute robots. enjoying making my own levels,1
the game is masterpiece! it gives you the opportunity to build you own levels and to play community created levels! the graphics are amazing and it is clear that the team did amazing job!,1
enjoyed by young nephew. my 4yo nephew loves the little robot  helping it navigate and finding a path to the goal. he also takes great joy in torturing the red robot by letting it fall in the water or leaving it stranded in an island.,1
i love this game. it is very simple and easy to play. there are ads in game but not many like other games. the ai of the bot is very good. he can find a definite path wherever we point.,1
pretty good game. nice graphics  and requires you to use your brain  buy not so hard you get stuck on every level.,1
great game. great concept. good amount of brain stimulation  love it to the core. best feature - make your own level.,1
best puzzle to play in this pandemic situation. it helped me increase iq  concentration and focus. it is also good for passing time,1
this is the best gaming experience i have ever had on android. it's so clean and smooth with such an interesting gameplay. this is a much underappreciated game on playstore.,1
i don't know if i get angry or laught when the robot go out the level. it's an amazing game whit a relax sound and good puzzles. the only thing that boter me is the automatic camera.,1
the best puzzle game ever. love it. martin magni great job. though i feel it may include more levels or worlds. but overall love it.,1
great simple and fun it's one of a kind game where we can pay what we want and it's light in memory too. best of all the games.plus no ads. the best,1
size doesn't matters. this is the least space eating game and i believe this tops that category. graphics  movements  configuration... everything is realistic.,1
it is very good puzzle game because it's all level are different you won't fill that this is repeating.......and also a very very good graphic...,1
the game is so smooooooth  it is so good  i recommend installing this  the calm music is awesome and the puzzle levels are challenging and rewarding... overall 5/5,1
gorgeous graphic and clever puzzles. it has no ads but it does ask you to make monetary contribution to the designer. i guess it's only fair.,1
nice haha...firstly i think its just easy game but i was wrong. this game is harder than i thought  to finish the puzzle you must think out of the box...for those not install this game yet....install keti..capat...sikapai kopio...aramai kasari maini...buli negidi buat your own puzzle sendiri......,1
not your usual head trainer. like other strategy games found here  it's a trial and error but unlike the others  mekorama also tests your patience and stress management.,1
addictive game that makes you think while having fun. very creative. good graphics and movement. game has a calming affect too.,1
i love it !! it makes my mind to think hard to find solutions that makes me happy . also   i completed the 50 puzzles in three days and started to make my own levels .,1
"love this game. using ai for its control. isometric style make me say ""wow"" immediately. the robot is so cute when it walks. great job! you build up my imajination about game.",1
great puzzle game! a little easy for me  but the graphics and concepts are great!,1
i cannot believe i found this game again.yaaaaaaay i thought i lost it.is there more than 50 cards?that is all i .i hope there are more levels.glow in the dark levels would be cool.please keep this game on google playstore forever i want this game to stay so i can play.i give more than 5  thank you for keeping the game i found it again.and offline to.,1
this game is really relaxing and somehow cute. i love watching the little robot walk around trying to reach the exit. its really fun and entertaining i really recommend.,1
definitely one of the best games i've played. simple yet so nice. love the fact that you can design your own level and how you can choose how much you want to give to the creator,1
amazing game,1
this game i the greatest puzzle game ive ever played but i feel like there shoud be a senstivity setting for moving blocks and/the camera. but do love this game its a great type of 3d maze game.,1
great game  must try once  other than the levels in the game  you can make levels and share them  or either play levels made by others,1
so far really good!just installed today and really loving it.a really great puzzle game and also that mini robotic character is reallyyy cute!!cant wait to explore new levels,1
this game is very nice and decent. the music gives soothing effect to ears . this game uses both your brain and virtual senses or creativity as you have to imagine that you are in there . i love this game,1
mega intertainer the protagonist is silly yeah like he is drunken all the time that makes it funny but i like the gameplay and the variety of imagination. i like the skill of martin magni the developer .he musg have an artistic skilled and vast talent ...thanks for this game.,1
the game is cool  but i feel like many of the puzzles are more focused on being patient than actually solving the puzzle.,1
this is the best puzzle game i've ever played. so sad the newest updated was 4 years ago. i hope you see my review martin because i love playing this game so much like back when i was high school,1
best and super game easy but mazes are cool awesome graphic and design easy to control making the level and playing is more fun.,1
i like how you don't use any ads to make money. i love this game it has a very cute robot and very good puzzles. i can't pay but still i want to support by rating this wonderful app.,1
love this game the music is cool thanks  the graphics  are cool the levels are the best   we can make our own levels l played this game for about 3 days but it all started again l had to play all levels again unfair dude l wasted my 3 days dude so unfair,1
this is the second time i have gone through this game and it was just as fun the second time. fantastic game. graphics are great and it is just challenging enough. one of the best games i have played!,1
it is really a very nice brain exercise game to play at anytime and it's background music is also very soothing. i loved it !!,1
nice puzzles. controls are a bit problematic on some levels but overall a great game!,1
really challenging puzzles with eye soothing graphics. a unique blend of gameplay and graphics i must say.,1
intriguing and challenging level design. makes you think and is very calming. best game i have played so far.,1
this game is awesome! it lets your imagination run wild as well as inspiring others to use their creativity! its fun to make and play puzzling levels in this game so that is why i gave it 5 stars.,1
i love this game vry much bcz it not only gives us levels to play but also the chance to make our own levels . it's so much fun to make our own levels.,1
fun and gets you to think. after the first puzzle  i was thinking this will get old real fast. it was too easy. now i find myself wanting hints,1
it's one the best game i have ever played..thanks to the creator for such a simple but tough game. loved the game for being a stress buster. makes me feel calm..at last  i wanna say that this game is one of it's kind.,1
cutest and most challenging puzzle game i have played. definitely not like the rest. great job devs!,1
i love this game. this is not a adventire game but yes it's a ouzzled game. must try once u r mind will blow up finding the way for bot. u can also build u r own level with ouzzle and also u can share it with freinds and give them a try to solve it.,1
perfect balance of fun and puzzling! the little robot guy is cute and each puzzle works my brain in a different way. absolutely love it,1
it was a fun and super interesting game!! i would really suggest it for anyone. the music and sound effects are really peaceful too!! loved it,1
if you like monument valley  give this a go. it's not quite the same  but the relaxing atmosphere and puzzle gameplay bring back the kind of feeling mv had.,1
thank you martin magni  i really loved this game. it's a puzzled 3d game a lot of entertainment. also you can make your own puzzles and share with your friends. good job!,1
simple gameplay but great fun if you like puzzles. some of the levels still elude me.,1
this game will expand a child's spatial intelligence and logic in solving 3-dimensional puzzles. i highly recommend it.,1
game is amazing  but upmill battle is broken. robot turn right does not go through the doorway and spins around in an infinite loop.,0
this is definitely an excellent game. but it has to improve a bit more to earn its 5th star. some levels of this game requires some specific camera angle. but i don't get them,1
it is the best game that i played ever . it is the best game that is playable easily . the graphic of this game is so fluent and fine .the developer is good for making easy and mind logical game . it is the game that you play but not like addict . it some part are addictable.,1
very nice game i feel so happy to play this game there are many levels in this game and some are difficult summer easy but it is interesting every level is interesting you will feel so happy to play this game right at least tried once,1

this game is unbelievably amazing. good controls. amazing graphics. relaxing soundtracks.,1
delightfully innovative  getting more challenging as you go on  but also more interesting. kudos for the developer!,1
i give it four...it's a great game... awesome graphics but there are no instructions to guide you and in build mode u can't even do anything......,1
it's a very excellent game in this format. and one thing is very surprise for me i make our many puzzle in this game. it's a low mb offline puzzle game. so why are you waiting . just download it.,1
such wonderful puzzles & so beautiful to look at & the little robot so cute & full of personality. now i'm spoiled forever  i can't find another game that measures up!!,1
a good logic based game  the levels are well thought and made  gradually the toughness inc  it's nice and brain tingling. good job and congrats to the developer and the team.,1
it was fun playing it but it is just so sad that it only contains 50 stages +25 master stages it took me only 1 hour to finish it so i tried improve i want to give it 4 stars but 5 is better for mr. matin magini i hope you create more levels in this game and improve the character .may you create more games like this.,1
i loved this game. the graphics is good the gameplay is simple and straight forward. the puzzles are amazing,1
a brilliant puzzle game -- this is a fantastic and enjoyable game that will make you think  and think outside the box  too!! very highly recommended!! ,1
beautiful game for almost all ages including my 5 year can play with little assistance. i can recommend for everyone to try it. great work to the creator.,1
superb and cute game. dont get too confident. it may seems easy at first but as you progress it be more challenging. really good to play during those free time,1
this is the best game but a problem is that you can't pass many levels and sometimes even the things that they are telling us to do . but overall in other things it's the best game,1
this game is great but it's missing some options features. there is no way to turn off the music or sound effects.,0
its an awesome games mind grooming game which is totally addless their are no adds poping up in this game which is more happening for me try it for free its worth it and it takes very less storage,1
great thinking game. nice graphics and great mechanics. best puzzle  thinking game in the store at this moment.,1
a great time killer and brain teaser game. also  the graphics is great and relaxing.,1
amazing graphics despite the low space taken. addictive and brain teasing. the perfect game! bravo!,1
this game is small but very powerful  each level of this game is challenging and interesting. i am giving five star not only for game but also for developers talent. very good.,1
amazing it has eazy levels that get harder and are challenging building can be hard but when you finish the level it's worth it,1
its quite interesting how it makes me think a lot. its not hard per say   but it definitely making my patience to work with. i like how i can make my own n share it with people too... kinda make me wonder how to be creative enough for this game too...,1
great fun game to pass by the time and makes you think. finished all the levels. only shame that there arent more!! would love more levels!!,1
best game ever. no ads  no fragmented game experience! you decide how much you pay for it  which means you can pay nothing  up to you.,1
pretty good game and puzzles. i thought it was too easy at first until i got stuck. no ad's good fun and passes the time by nicely.,1
it is very relaxing game. the best part is making our own levels but i think that all levels should be open at once,1
very interesting puzzle game  simple and high quality graphics   quite addictive  i would highly recoomend this game if anyone is searching for puzzle game...,1
one of the best game too get rid of boring lectures just gear up with controls and then its just perfect..,1
actually i would give 1 out of 5. i give 3++ for graphics  that's almost 4. and one for asking pay   give support to developers   etc. i finished my 50 cards - thank you - had fun - good job. simply said.,1
nice game it challenges our mind but im very sad that i can't pay.but i request the people who can pay please pay as this game is very beautiful and i try to make the levels by my own but it takes 2 to3 days and also has some mistakes so please pay and it is a very good game,1
great graphics  imponderable gameplay. send you into buildings so you can't even see where you're going. idiotic.,0
the gameplay is challenging and the fact that u can create ur own puzzles makes it outstanding  love it alot.,1
this game is perfect for anyone who loves puzzle games. it is challenging  but still solvable. it looks cute too,1
nice game. some parts can be challenging but not impossible. the music is calming and the robot is so cute.,1
simple  small sized  best puzzle game ... plus you can also make your own levels which is super fun or play other user made levels by scanning their or code,1
it was good this is the first geniune review im writing about a game  i love this game this game is addicting and you get to choose how much you pay or even play for free and even if you play it for free its not constatly shoving ads down my throat and the game is very instresting as well attention catching highly recommend it,1
this is a well designed  fun game. the graphics are flawless and quite stylish. the game play is straightforward and easy to use.,1
fun spacial puzzle game. some are quite straight forward  but others take some work to puzzle out.,0
really enjoyed the game  and love when you finish a hard level and then the name of the level hits you.,1
it's adorable. i love the art style and the character movements. the levels are nicely puzzled.,1
i give it four stars because it's a amazing game i have been playing for about a week and the levels are really well made   i am having so much fun playing this in my free time . but i don't get hits   it says i have to pay for it...,1
unique puzzle game. pretty easy so far  but still really fun. i liked the double layer maze.,1
one of its kind! i can't believe i've played such an epic game. i don't know how many nights had martin spent in making this game.its only 5.4 mb! such cool graphics and controls! 50 levels of insanity !,1
i love the game it small in but have great graphics and allows you to make your own levels.,1
great interactive puzzles with moderate difficulty and it even has the option to build puzzles which is also a fun experience,1
it's a really good game  me and my friends passed the all level without any tips and enjoyed the game. my frends also enjoyed this game ...the robot was very cute.all levels are interesting and harder.i feel happy because i passed all the levels,1
nice graphics great idea and a very good implementation the custom levels make it much more enjoyable best thing is it's free and doesn't contain any ads,1
it's really an interesting game. the developer has created really amazing puzzles to solve.i think everyone should try it.,1
the best game i've played so far. i love the the design of puzzles and the robot. the robot is super cute! highly recommend!,1
used to play this all the time with my 6-7 year old  then my phone broke. just came across it again  and my son is 9 yrs old now  and we both still love it! thank you!,1
wonderful and challenging game all the levels are challenging. special mentions for level 29 'open sesame' was incredible level 46 'sarlacc pit' was out of my imagination,1
hi dear developer. your game is cool and fun to play. but could you please adjust the way we view the obstacles like making it 360 degrees. not just sideways. thank you dear developer,1
one of the best puzzle game although might be confusing and very time sensitive at later levels.,1
really beautifully designed game.... boosts up your problem solving skill ( i think so).....very nice and tricky game. need your full attention while you are playing it,1
lovely graphics  simple but fun gameplay and a cute little robot thing to play as. amazing game all round.,1
great game. lots of fun. some levels are quite straightforward others are feindishly difficult to work out.,1
it's awesome game... the complete exercise of brain.. i wish it would come to my knowledge in the lockdown days. one question.. why the hints are not available for free,0
the game is good  in some stages it is difficult and challenging. it's recommended for puzzle games,1
it's a simple game in terms of presentation but the puzzles are fun and intelligent. great game,1
a really liked this game a lot!! i completed the game in three weeks it was hard but i did it . and i need more levels as soon as possible...very fun and enjoyable game !!,1
this is an amazing mind blowing game with lots of puzzling levels and if thatbis not enough you can create you own. check it out. thanks to the developers.,1
the simplicity of this game is top notch and u can even make ur own notes in every stage!! how awesome one can innovate their art is mind boggling!!! thanks for making this game mate,1
the game is good...liked it but you should keep few hints for free...and you also need to give game poitns...as the level 19 is so tough we need to see the hints but the hints are paid so please keep some hints for free...or make game poitns which me help during games,0
this game is cool! the puzzle  the graphic  the character and other stuff is amazing!!! and always make me laugh everytime i died and yeah love this game! ,1
i wish there was an option to disable bgm. i couldn't play because the music sounds glitched and gives me terrible anxiety.,0
excellant game......the concept is simple yet challenging ...... the game is spotless till now...full marks....would add recommendation after completion,1
simply wonderfull. keeping brain engaged. loved it. crossed all level. eagerly waiting for the new challenging levels.,1
loved the concept and the simplicity is its greatest plus point. addictive and lovable and the thing of editing our own level is what makes me play this game more further...,1
great game  but there should be a fast mode or less time consuming mode in which the robot appears where pressed cuz it takes up a lot of time sometimes,0
the app is really good. it doesn't lag. no ads. levels are awesome. a level passed feels like you're a little less of a disappointment to your family.,1
super awesome concept  nice graphics  crazy animations  but we can rotate only on x axis if we can rotate y axis too  it will be better....,0
very exiciting game.but the control is little bit problematic the graphics always facing in a certain angle otherwise very addictive game.,0
honesty  an amazing game. the graphics are quiet good  for a puzzle game of this kind. it pushes ur mind well enough to enjoy it.,1

such an amazing game with beautiful & very impressive graphics at such low mb. i gotta say this is 'the' best classic game i ever played. really exciting & funny game. kudos to the developers.,1
physics are too slippery and the ai seems to be weak  most of the time the robot just falls off over simple things like walking over another robot or standing on a moving block.,1
camera controls can be a little annoying at times but it is a super fun  relaxing puzzle game,1
i like the game.it is fun and awesome.sometimes the levels can be puzzle but as for me i can think out the solution just in a sec.i give this game 5 stars because it reminds me of captain toad on the nintendo wii u,1
noice game good puzzles  but the level editor could do with a tutorial explaining how to use it properly.,1
one of the best games i have played. would appreciate addition of some new blocks to build which can promote new mechanics to play.,1
its the cutest game and so so so lovely game amazing mind blowing i hope it has infinite level thank you so much. graphics n controls all are superb.,1

so nice game. it needs both time and brain. i just love to play it. there are master cards which are quite hard.,0
i love how the levels are simple yet you have to put thought into them  then the complicated ones have the easiest solution.,0
very good game but please add a feature of ending the game when you are zapped  i want to create a surving game; you are in a place with zapped bots and in the other side  a robot is in his way to the win.but when you are zapped the other robot continues his trip and you can easily win...,0
for a long time i was thinking that should i download it or not i thought it is a vr and a building game so i thought no but then i thought let finally download it after playing sometime i got to know that it is a very nice game and creative also i really liked it.,0
the game was really awesome low on mbs but high graphics make more games like mekoram but in different places and defrent actors'you now this is my first time giving a game 4stars i usually give all games 3 star because of mbs and graphics you are the first people to be give 4stars by me make more games like that but with vehicles and others,0

super game  super graphics  super &simple music. n the robot is really soo cute  specially the way he walks. its like a small baby .,1
the game is good but it happens that the robot clips outside of the playing area to walk outside of bounds. is that a bug or placed on purpose?,1

its an amazing creative game but the controls not so much and theres only low amount of blocks maybe add more to make it more colorful and alot creative,1
i love this game but i think it needs to spice up a little bit. i think it needs multiplayer and dinffrent colors like green pink blue and yellow.,1
a light simple and brilliant game. this game is ideal for anyone who wants to work on their logical or cognitive abilities.,1
great puzzle game  very unique. player can make their own level n share it with each other.,1
lovely game. very relaxing and visually cute puzzle game. such a pleasant surprise to play a game where adverts and premium currency are not rammed down your throat.,1
it is the best that puzzle games has to offer in less than 6 mb you get beautiful and clean graphics and challenging levels. one of the best time killer,1

i hope you may make another game but it's better from all games and we wish that you can do it in mekorama there is very simple equation and also very difficult solution which make a time of an 5 min by the way i like mmekorama it's not have much mb like another i like it thanks for this game,1

can't help but mention a favorable comparison to monument valley. it has similar game play  but different enough to make it all shiny new for me. i like it.,1

i like it cz it's a unique puzzle game. only 1 thing i don't like it's background music.... it makes me irritate... i suggest to put some melody music,1
good game like monument valley but in this game you stuck sometimes and you need hints to end the level. it's entertaining and puzzle game.,1
"i like it a lot. very simple control and very good brain exercise. the ""build own maze "" idea and then qr code sharing is even more awesome",1
its an awesome game and the option to create your own level is something new which cant be seen in any of the game its intresting it also aquires less space and i liked this game,1

victor visser : games great,1
damian raghoonanan : pros: -great game to play. - easy controls. -nice cars to drive -drifting is awesome cons and things to maybe implement into the game : -sometime when drifting the car will lock up and swerve into the walls or fencing making you restart -the mission when it tells you to drive a specific car but you don't have it and forced to buy it when your coins is low is irritating at time -the mission to see if you completed them,0
siddiq 069 : this game is awesome. the controls are simple. i fell in love with the drift mechanics. everything is perfect. since this game has getting popular,1
atish ghosh : a great game! needs a bit of getting used to,1
iulian toma : awesome! the only bug that i experienced is that,1
nicholas wachon : this isn't just a phone game. this is a work of art. an amazing style that translates to both its location and vehicle design. gameplay is solid with nice nuances to master. one thing i would recommend for players to do is to turn off the ingame music and play music from your phone while in the game. that really adds to the roadtrip asthetic that the game conveys super well already. highly recommend.,0
mitchell davies : definitely worth downloading,1
carl linden : fantastic variety of classic cars! and not just the fast ones! my favorites are the trabant and 126p. names of the all the vehicles are very well thought through as well. if i had a complaint it's the music and perhaps the floaty camera that makes me a little nauseous,0
random person : it's nice and fun,1
j sherriff : the game is a very nice blend between modern and retro... and it plays well,1
corban woods : the game does everything it says it does and much more. every feature of the game is well thought out on how it interacts with the other aspects of the game making it a fun and casual game. you can play it casually whilst still being able to compete against others. one of the best free driving games on the play store,1
nuraeni : best driving game,1
sam arvy sayam : the game was fun but i found a bug on japan map wherein the record of distance and other stuff is not recorded. also the interface needs to be improve. overall its fun to play hoping to fix the bug immediately,0
djr99 : i love this game,1
alx propka : nice,1

ismael chabs : the game is super basic but has a lovely art style. i would say that's the whole appeal of it,1
jesse bek : this is a very good quality game and i definitely recommend this. there is adds however and they do get annoying sontimes,0
mayank mehta : great artstyle which is equally complimented by great maps and chill music. the game is great for playing casually while listening to podcasts n stuff. also includes a wide array of cars to play with including cop cars,1
manvendra : nice game ,1
sunteeth the genderpunk : its good. nothing too groundbreaking but worthwhile. doesnt pester you with microtransactions,1
k zam : game is good. im finding it hard for braking though i just wish there was an option for a break button. but the art is superb,1
adil sewcharan : the steering is very annoying and doesn't make for an enjoyable run. other than that its good quality game that looks pretty slick.,1
saker alabas : love the game,1
jordan araujo : not your normal endless runner,0
tristan gamez : really good game ! a lot of cars from the 70s and that's change with other games who only have 90s jdm cars. the graphics are original and looks good. the maps number is ok and the control are easily to pickup. there's still things that can be improve or add,1
bowen m : very fun game,1
ked jules : i've been playing this little cuty for almost 2 year now,1
wafflez playz : over all,1
ildefonso rafael casas padilla : i updated my rating for this game to . i would definitely like to see more quests throughout the game. and instead of being rewarded vans,1
goodbinary : ok,1
malathi saravanapandian : this game has great graphics and controls. but a little harder to drive. also road tracks are super. this is a good game,1
franjo vranjkic : #drive is one of the best games in it's genre. my favorite part is the business model: pay once,1
random google user : very nice #drive ing game,1
aysha khanam : this game is absolutely awesome. i think i got blessed. i don't have word now.how amazing and cinematic game is this!!but it would be more epic if you give a update. and the update will be a mode where it is only mode for crash. i mean like zen mode pro cam mode beside these there will be crash mode it will only crash and make the road block)!,1
clint s. : (slava ukraini) (and poland,1
yevhen revko : awesome experience that resonates with the late '70s - mid '80s movies like the original gone in 60 seconds and early driver games. nice handling for an arcade game and awesome low-poly visuals,1
some guy : the game is nicely polished and looks stylish but it's the controls that makes it a 4 star but that just my own opinion. you developers need to add new cars and maybe game modes,1
cyan tasks : one of the very few games nowadays that don't focus on milking your wallet until its dry. nice attention to detail with the different types of food for differemt maps,1
gachaeli : fun arcade racing game. you drive as long as you can until you crash/run out of fuel. the cars look great,1
arfan maulana : this game's a really fun casual experience for people looking for an endless run kinda game. it has no frills,1
jason burleigh : really enjoyable and addicting little game! been playing a short time and already seem to have worked through most everything with the exception of car unlocks,1
tozo yozo : we have full 3d view access for photo in the game but,1

austin eudy : not bad,1
norris white : good game,1
non metallic : this game is a masterpiece. i have no problems with this game. amazing soundtracks,1
ara kazarian : amazing! please guys,1
sk nikhath : the controls are worst they need to improve the controls to drive the car the graphics are good but controls can make you anger while playing,0
joshua prasetya : it's actually quite fun and addictive. but there's an ad that we can't close it,1
jon harris : fun game. easy controls,1
v t chacko vilayappillil : really enjoying ur game ,1
marcus justin lim : this game is overall just amazing. one problem i've encountered is that i can't load into tofuyama after the latest update. i hope the devs look into this,0
sean marvin mendoza : the game is very good,1
eric lamoureux : cool little game & nice,1
duy ta xuan : game doesn't go past the first loading screen. this game used to be playable on lower-end devices,1
caleb comier : it's a good way to spend some fee time. the only thing is it can be annoying when you have to make sharp turns.,0
cosyhamster : now there is gamepad (controller) support because of the nintendo switch release. honestly,1
k.h -es 300 : i think it is realy fun to play,1
sulma humes : i like this game its good the graphics are awesome too keep up the good work!just a thought maybe u should add manual acceleration and the steering wheel it would really change the game so can u pls do that? thanks,1
zepazonda zephere : ok tapi obstacle dengan traffic tu annoying lah. depends on driving skills. arcade macam ni pun graphics mantap . this game has brought me back to the 80s,0
leon bernik : i like the easy controls and the art style. great game for when you dont know what to do.,1
avtomat : i mean,1
shefboii : the car randomly turns on its own sometimes n i get it's supposed to add a degree of difficulty to the game but it gets annoying still a fun game tho,1
amy bricknell : this is the best game i have ever played!!!!!it is amazing. i love the cars do you know that i have the monstertruck i love the tracks aswell. and its cool how you set it out. and it doesn't come of the phone!!!yaaaaaaaaay. so you get the point i like the game it is the best,1
sadness : awesome! even though its just a endless subwaysurfer type game with cars it feels different. im not a fan of top down cam but this ones cam angle is fun can u guys another camera mode pls?like a lil bit more closer to the car then it would be sooo fun to drift.,1
metalman690 : great little time waster that doesn't require internet connection. easy to pick up,1
anas akz : i give it 3 stars cuz it is laggy and it dont have butoons to drive with and we also can use the break once then after 5,1
barnabas daniel : very enjoyable and addictive game with great graphics...but how are we supposed to save our progress online? and please add a fullscreen feature,1
dawn eckelberry : love the game. tho it's really easy to lose control so making the roads a little bigger would help,1
mohamad ithar : so far so good. game is challenging and fun at the same time. just maybe the breaking cooldown should be faster,1
bigbear : i enjoy it but there's not enough roads to get and it takes too long to collect caps especially when you have to spend them on cars you don't even want just to complete one of the goals,0
angel kuilan : it's a really good game and i like how it's a little bit challenging because you got a lot going on. this game would be better if there was like a race mode or something like that.,1
ruben ramirez : easy controls,1
truckrobo147 : its really fun and it feels like the road would never end and it also has wonderful collection of cars and get them with bottle caps is a fun idea!,1
bokibashub : this game is very cool and a bit realistic.then you break,1
"christopher rossler : cool game. name of the cars are super funny and always nod to some pop culture. hint to the devs. in german it's ""der wagen"" not ""das wagen"".",1
kaylen abuaqel : this is the best car game i have seen yet ngl. it is so easy to get money(caps) in this game and get new games. i would tell everbody to play this game emedently.,1
jack fagan : not a normal mobile game it's not a pay to play and adds are optional there is plenty to do and the art style is cool the devs add new content such as new cars and places to go evey so often. the game is basically you driving forward for as long as you can while collecting money and doing side quest and avoiding the cops every so often. the graphics are great and there is even a picture mode. the cars are all cool some even coming with special abilities such as cops won't chase you. good game.,0
andrey baste : i really like this game. attention to details is what buys me. music on the background,1
a.k. rebel : fantastic balance of appropriate humor,1
sir abhishek : i don't usually right reviews on play store but man is this game so good i had to right a review. the graphics are cartoony but in a good way...the sound tracks for each map are bangers. no unnecessary inapp purchase needed to progress. i have played lot of games both android and pc and this is in my opinion one the bests hands down,0
vivek jayan : fun game. love the art style and the care/attention to detail. car mechanics could've been a bit tighter. they feel a bit boat-like. but i guess that's the challenge. keep it up guys. your team's passion is very evident.,1
henry pettigrew : try as i might,1
masterchef : controls are simple but fun. the upgrade system takes some getting used to and confused me at first. progression is a little slow but speeds up as you level up. no technical problems. a fun game to just pick up and play for a few minutes.,0
carson williams : great game,1
milan milanzi : you won't get disappointed for sure. bit of repetition in the game [sounds & dialogue]. too many ads.,0
drasila rowaro : i love the graphics and the car but it's hard to play but i love it thank you so much,1
shashank k.g : even though it shows that i am linked with my account that has more progress..... but the problem is where is the progress!! it shows i am still level 1,0
abdul hasan : this game is really really fun but there alot of glitches,1
wyatt talbot : it is definitely interesting. no forced ads,1

jay kozatt : love it to bits! the game loop is addictive,1
youguang yi : thanks for the latest car update,1
dhruv karmakar : i used to play this game months back,1
tempo slapzy : it's a really good game it keeps me entertained and i like that it gets more challenging as difficult without even noticing till you almost crash lol,1
nathan fanning : good game but the brakes shouldn't be limited. also need to make it an open world chas be much better if you did,0
project redemption : fun game kind of hard to get use to. it also have tons of cars to buy and drive.,1
dre awofusi : it's smooth and engaging.. feels like you taking a ride in cities and having task to complete along the way ..,1
leonard rey chua : this game is a time killer and gameplay is beautiful may i suggest can you add more places like tokyo,1
"wilczur : a really nice game with a lot of ""classic"" cars from many different countries and the game is still getting more stuff which is very nice",1
tyler burns : i love how even though they updated the game it still has the same classic music,1
robert rarrick : it takes some getting used to but the game overall it seems like a good game to play when i'm waiting for something and like waiting for my meal at mcdonald's type stuff,1
amirul daniel : this game are awesome but why i can't play at tofuyama because i stuck at loading screen ....can you fix this for all player .... i hope you can fix this problem,0
ostan5000 : this game has a lot of creativity put behind it. you can definitely tell that the people who made it have a great taste in cars!,1

lowo : zen mode,1
d sun : great game,1
mara : good controls. nice selection of cars to choose from.,1
ani goodness : cool game no it's a great game but make some improvements to the controls like tilting some of us actually like that,1
danilo okovic : it's a great game overall,1
fox crizone : it's nice to have a quality game for once. this should be the ads we get on youtube,1
"flaming diamond master : #drive is a stuning game worth playing as long as you don't mind slowley progrestng thou cars and it's ""postcard"" idea is ok reastrant so you can unlock places a lot less qwicker and over all it's one of my best games (for the mobile or tablet if you are reading this on there)in my list",0

sapiderman lumpat : great fungky background vibe,1
ty sells : i like it. socks it didn't restore all my progress when i switched phones but it's still fun!,1
ymy 2577 : i like this game but one thing you need to setting.when i go to setting change control like it have drift.then,0
uriah miano : like,1
f4rish 1304 : best.easy controls and realistic.in next update could you customized car.,1
pars 99 : very very baaad it can not load the game stop at the start whay you guys don't fix this bug????,0
superbattle45 : the game is great it's will be amazing there more maps also when i try to play japan part it stuck at loading screen,0

camogap : to begin with,1
x-calibur : it's honestly not a bad game,1
nolawi engida : the best game ever but add a little more action overall love it . keep it up,1
kevin j. : wow... i think i watched 5 ads in less than 5 minutes bahaha. crazy! devs really want you to spend that $2.99. the controls we atrocious,1
john smith : been playing for 30 minutes,0
joseph pinter : sensitive driving and seems like lots to do,1
jesus cardona : the cleanest game ever but it could be a bit more interesting with a few things added like ramps,1
gerard patrice : very interesting game and take on racing/driving. i see the game is also on switch that's awesome,1
michael westen : so much effort and style. too bad it's full of typical mobile game bs,1
keith montgomery : i love this app because there are so many different types of vehicles to win. the game is easy to play with excellent graphics and lots of fine detail in the scenery. well done to the app devlopers.,1
nunya bidnis : play 20 seconds get 30 second ad. play 15 seconds crash another 20 second ad. ludicrous. uninstalled.,0
leaton wright : this game looks good,1
keith david opulencia : the game is great. the graphics are awesome. location-wise and car-wise,1
william elser : the game is somewhat fun but lacks depth. i unlocked the levels fairly quickly and found it easy to grind caps on the forest level so it wasnt long until i got the most expensive car. unfortunately this car feels almost the same as the car i started with. not very rewarding for the grinding. cops are ineffective and just stop following you after a short while. this game could use some alternate game modes and difficulty tweaks. i've pretty much stopped playing due to how repetitive it is.,1
constantina v. : finally,1
pixality dev : i remember seeing posta about this game on an indie dev facebook group. i couldn't wait to play it! now that i've had a chance to download and try it. i love it! it's lots of fun and the controls are great! sure they're hard for people nt used to the touch controls. but they're good,1
moaz malik : good game,1
tony west : the game is nicely put together & the graphic style is great & with the music & the voices captures the vibe of 70s movies well. however a casual game like this,1
mr. barrel : okay,1
amantacha 19 : i really love this game. the graphics are really nice,1
t. c. b. : #drive is a fun endless drive with small bonuses and challenges to complete. it has a fun style and there are a lot of cars to choose from,1
"charles sieburg : amazing there are only a couple of very small things i would change. 1: i wish there was a way to completely downgrade grip. drifting is what makes this game amazing. 2: it wouldn't be that hard to a a ""city"" freeroam version where you can left or right as well as forward. they could totally charge for it",1
ck7a : best game ever,1
ryan greythorn : the game itself is paying a great homage to your childhood top-down racing game,1
barez barznji : i love this game,1
o j : this game is great and has few ads. the steering seems finicky at first,0
supratik deb : it's a nice game. the control takes a little time to get used to. suggestions - when i began playing,1
daniel : good casual driving fun. the visuals are stylised but not too cartoonish; the car handling is simple and arcadey but not so that there's no difference between all the cars; there's a nice selection of different cars and environments. all i hope for in future updates is more environments and i'd like some different passenger voices; not that i dislike the current one,1
ben crockford : this is one of my favourite games of all time. the graphics are amazing,1
brennan lyle : this is a pretty fun infinite-driving type of game where you have to dodge traffic,1
chinmay ghule : what a gorgeous game! i have nothing to say. this game is just pleasing to the eyes. if i really want to find a fault,1
rubied snoot : gotta say,1
ian palmer : great endless runner,1
ferraro's garage : this game is awesome,1
"jesse stewart : this is easily the best ""endless running"" game (endless driving in this case) that i've played. each new car is fun and not too difficult to unlock. they all have great steering mechanics. and the customization of your vehicles is a neat feature. the graphics are also spot on for the type of game they're going for. 6 stars out of 5.",0
simon quattrone : the beginning stage/environment is ideal in terms of its difficulty,1
joe maina : 10/10. graphics are and physics are great and there are so much things to explore and maps. i recommend downloading this game. and there are many different types of cars. the bad thing is you need to grind alot. please add more modifications.and its not a pay to win game.the voice acting is great i love how they put so much effort into this game.,0
pentox : this is the first game that i leave a review on,1
charalampos papaioannou : for a quick and nice time spender,1
le leedler : this game is weird for me,1
jerome chavez : fun game. my only problems is that navigating in car selection is trash as i keep misclicking while using the arrow keys due to them being small and hard to touch. also,1
bruno volonteri : this is,1
aron : challenging and rewarding. i really like this game! the progression is pretty grindey,1
scott c. : this is one of those so called 'endless runner' games where you're not in complete control of your character (in this case,1
armani : it looks good,1
killerrabbitx : i've changed my mind about this game,1
amanda duncan : this game is a very fun infinite runner that you can pick up and play anytime,1
aniket debnath : i freaking love the game man. it's genuinely one of the games i've kept downloaded longest on my phone. i love the maps,1
ollie thomas : really good concept! once you start to get a feel for the controls it's really nice to play,1
shashank seth : excellent graphics. talking about the controls,1
eric e franco m : this game is sweet! it checks all the boxes. the #visuals are beautiful,1

akshay jumani : a very good game overall with a retro feel. i'd suggest that we get a seperate garage tab to purchase cars,1
no : 4.6 out of 5,1
neil caezar : amazing game,1
connor watkins : 5 star game for sure. the graphics are really nice and have a great polygonal style to them. it runs offline,1
twocheslch : great game for about 10 minutes. the list of cars is pretty expensive,1
marc russell : nice game with great graphics and sound gets a lot of updates,1
mohamed hussein : best f***ing game on the store! absolute beauty! not only the driving is great,1
ushnish saha : the game is excellent but there are some bugs which i came across while playing. the car selection method can be better. one suggestion: you can make a feature that if players touch the key they will find there car. the bug which i came across is that while find the cars,1
jerry jackson : i don't mind advertising in games,1
"samarth khanna : i find this game extremely relaxing. i really love the idea of going on an endless journey with a calm but energetic and enthusiastic voice to accompany you. my only problem with the game is that i wish it had an ""easy"" mode or something to adjust the difficulty",1
"zackary edinger : great throwback to racing games of the 90s. graphics are simple but have style. the selection of cars shows the developer knows their audience. a lot of people knock the controls but once you ""get it"" they're perfect. my complaint would be that sometimes buildings are generated in the middle of the road",0
daniel m : played the game for a few minutes and i'm not too impressed. a slider or motion turning would be much better; the car is difficult to control with buttons due to the mechanics of the game. graphics are okay but when you crash it's simple animations and it's boring and annoying. perhaps adding some health to the car and physics to the game would be a great improvement. smashing cars out of the way and seeing them go tumbling would be great.,0
mrshenanigans : don't see why this game has such high reviews. the controls are bad at best,0
james kanas : i absolutely love the 70's influence,1
ditiro shayi : kudos,1
goran ratkovic : such a great game,1
hiraya : great game but... maybe you could add some more features like missions,1
cody smith : the game as a lot of content from what i gather so far. and its a really solid timewaster when you're stuck somewhere. the ads arent too intrusive and you're able to pay to disable them which is nice. theres a decent collection of cars which makes me want to collect them all. there's multiple maps which is a must. i do wish there was more customization for the cars. you can change the cars colors but i wish you could tint your windows,0
dudemanbro 2006 : this game is amazing! its very fun and super addictive. the controls are easy to get used to and you can choose from 3 different control options. the tracks are all very neat to look at as well. there are also so many cars. and they are all awsome! the only thing is that mayby you can add music more like chase music. like from smokey and the bandit and movies like that. that would be amazing. but overall a superb game!,1
next project gaming : the handling is too difficult to manage. i've played most of the racing games including one on the consoles,1
hazmatbp : i love the amount of cars there are to choose from,1
tom : great game super chill wide range of cars and almost no ads,1
jayanth challa : the most lovable driving game. thank you for showing ukraine and show all other countries too.,1
use : whaff app : get iok doiiars : i have never lost a drive by missing fuel station. almost always that's because of hitting an other car. the police is also not any threat. on the other hand,0
david moore : fun game. small amount of ads (i mean that in a good way.) and thats all i really have to say about it,1
user anonymus : this is an incredible game,1
saurav allen : very well rounded endless runner! though the physics are a bit jarring but they are the defining characteristics of the game's dna and are easy to get used too. the scenery is eventful and the ui and other design elements are elegant. the cars and music are from the 90s and the game is theme based. definitely a good pastime. the progression rate is just right too!,1
danny wright : vary pleasing to look at and very litte ads. way more than i expected,1
robert chambers : it's been 20 minutes so far and the game is nice. only hang up is the whole braking situation. you have to give up steering to brake because you have to use both thumbs to brake. and the brakes only last for literally 1 second and then you cant use your brakes again for another 30 seconds or more. what's up with that? other than that,0
scratch83 : second review because the developer clearly didnt bother reading my last one before a default comment!!! i downloaded this terrible game on a brand new s21. each time i try to start the (cr)app it just gives me a black screen. complete waste of time,0
konstantin kiss : too many ads. game is solid,0
abhishek sharma : this game feels so good and cool at the same time. the music catches your brain . have to say it's lit.,1
pranab pant : with a surprising sense of speed despite a relatively low if consistent frame rate and turning a lot smoother than many other better-looking and better-tuned racers,1
samke mtshali : sorry i try playing you game but it keeps on crashing on my huawei y5 2018 lite how can i fix the issue i would give it a 5 star but i give it 2 for crashing,1
nemanja vladisavljev : awsome and fun game perfect for driving.,1
itzychismo : this is a good game but graphics need some work on and also i unlocked like 4 cars and i can't use them,0
ashish bhadauria : sure! this games looks and feel amazing. but i willl only point out downsides. 1. bit difficult 2. let the user engage with difficulty over time. 3. braking control bit odd,1
lee hermano : the game looks good,1
om ji maurya : gameplay is incredible whether it's regular or zen mode.graphics is beautiful and selection of cars is also good. controls are good enough but choice of control are somewhat lacking. overall it's really a great game and probably best endless racing game. you can feel that developer has really a good taste and artistic sense. a few improvement are needed in controls to make drifting a bit easier and add options for different camera angles. more control options and customised touch controls .,1
j rhodes : i've really been enjoying this game. the art style is what pulled me in and is really solid. the gameplay is easy to pick up abd has a decent learning curve. it feels great to get to drive a new car with more power,1
vishuv sethi : good graphics and smooth gameplay. i am liking it :) one - star for a bug : if you watch a video when you crash,1
samuel graczyk : very responsive,1
tom robinson : most driving games on android try to copy games from consoles and computers far more suited to the style than phones or tablets will ever be. drive does things differently and knowing the limitations of mobile gaming has made a thoroughly enjoyable game! i know some have complained about ads in the free version,1
hunter brown : really fun game to play,1
vince : i'm giving this 5 stars because i think it deserves over 100 million downloads,1
tactical baguette : i wasn't expecting much from this game but it's surprising how fun it is. it's similar to other endless runner games but with more freedom than swiping between 3 lanes. the car selection is very large with plenty of cars from the 70's and 80's,1
andrei scherer : overall an decent game. the game really does want you to crash though. i mean a narrow highway with pretty much no shoulder,1
caleb a. : amazing game. love the controller support.,1
ad : great graphics! funny commentary. and loved the fact you could throw donuts at the cops. also the car selection was awesome. i'm saving up to get the japanese delivery truck. awesome sound tracks from the moment the app loaded up. however,1
yvonne kunda : this game is horrible....i tried downloading this game x5 on different phones...yet wasting my time downloading it and data if you are downloading it cancel it and if you want to download it don't!,1
jason mergel : game is good but control sensitivity for the steering could be better,1
arlon waggoner : im loving this game there are so many cool cars alot of maps and diversity and i like the coolness button overall good game,1
kieran morgan : enjoyable game,1
ivan urban : great graphics,1
cosmic : game plays fantastic! once you get used to the controls and find your favourite car theres no stopping you. in the length of time i've played maybe an hour or two i've already unlocked another track and bought 3 of my favourite cars. i feel the mechanics and reward system are well balanced so far and with some minor tweaking will be perfect. collision detection seems fair and is defendant on what size vehicle you drive. the visuals,1
enrico carasco : please fix the tofuyama map. my progress is not being recorded.,0
vicente cierva jr : nice game dev,1
joao berlindo : i haven't played for a very long while but from what i've seen this is a very fun game for those looking to just drive off into the sunset but still needing to dodge a few things on their way,1
adrian p : great game,1
how2code group ltd. : wow! this game is all you will ever need. amazing graphics,1
anand kumar : has good drifting features and all,1
jak : great game for the porcelain throne. graphics are really very stylized and the cars look amazing. driving is tough to get the hang of at first,1
josef stout : some nice ideas but i quickly got bored having to start from the same point in every level,1
dhwanil chudgar : this game is super fun,1
slade nuyten : it's a nice game,1
unfoundable : its a great game good amount of cars the driving is kinda hard but it gets easy when you get used to it,1
"travis ruetenik : another perfectly fun game ruined by an insurmountable mission. i've spent over an hour of gameplay time trying to achieve ""to seconds of drift"" and even changed the control mode",1
francois orsini : great graphics but the biggest issue are controls which can be finicky. offer a tilt control mode and add some drift and break buttons which is pretty standard. there is definitely some tiny lag when steering the car. dev should work on the controls as without great controls,0
dutch brother : great little game. tons of progression. friendly discord server. not all that many adds,0
jonatan edrik tanoto : great graphics,1
colten potts : really entertaining. it is very challenging and high quality. the variety of vehicles and maps lead to endless fun,1
ken esaga : i recommend adding sports cars and aesthetic cars to make the game more interesting,1
travis puariea : very very very very awesome game. 20/10. the art style,1
donathan : a fun little game with a cool aesthetic,1
take flight : fun game,1
alessandro thome : this game is one of the best mobile games i have ever seen. amazing controls,1
dkkl dicer : love it. art style is unique and the gameplay is pure fun. with a minimalist approach to the game,1
john krayeski : i love this game and play it on my phone and it works extremely well and it is a very good game and i strongly recommend it,1
"nani 'bella' popper : the most laid-back test of wit & reflex i've experienced with a ""true"" arcade game yet. the simple",1
usama yousaf : i like the game because of it's graphics quality,1
craig h : horrible terrible controls. played for less than 2 minutes and frustration does not begin to describe the experience. just try to steer even a little bit and your vehicle goes out of control. i'm shocked at how quickly i decided to quit and uninstall this app. i don't want to call it a game because games are fun to play. this was not fun. i can't fathom how this app is trending so high. must have paid for the placement. anyway,0
grayson gillard : this game is one of the most beautiful,1
mateusz tegi : to be perfectly honest this is the best racing game i've ever played on mobile and maybe even beats some of the ones i played on my pc. the adds aren't bashful and only appear when the player wants to see them for some extra money. the graphics are really good and the game runs smoothly on my device. controls are simple but intuitive and responsive. i really have to say that i'm impressed and this game is one of my favorites on mobile. i congratulate the developers for doing such a good job.,1
razidin usman : i have nothing much to say more or less the game looks good but it's too short,1
liam lewis : such a good game,1
el duderino : i absolutely love how player friendly this is,1
johhni 77 : this game is amazing - the art style is lovely,1
ziggy alpha : game was fantastic but challenge that requires you to drive 25k with the hachitofu in tofuyama doesn't seem to be working and now i'm stuck at level 19,0
giorgi megrelidze : i spent 3 hours playing this game and its so good. its offline and it trully just drags you in.,1
adam ziebarth : terrible controls at any setting,0
cody beckius : love the game but only gave it 3 stars because the sound is messed up pretty bad. it sound like a robotic voice in super slo mo when any dialog pops up. other than that the game seems to run pretty smooth. ill keep it for a week and see if anything changes. if not itll be uninstalled,0
zane barker : many cars and stuff to try just wish it was a little easier to make money that's about it.,1
ilias t : wow! what a game! absolutely brilliant game. the graphics are stunning,1
ksempac : technically sound,1
bartomiej szlachta : i have never lost a drive by missing fuel station. almost always that's because of hitting an other car. the police is also not any threat. on the other hand,0
leo nguyen : i love this cozy driving game! it's 10x better with a controller.,1
evan matthews : great game if anyone remembers driver for ps2 you will love this game the grafics and music are great,1
kickin it with dae dae & dre dre : i think he's doing this,1
ruvik b.l. : an excellent game with fun gameplay and superb graphics and style,1
diyana kamaruddin : this game is almost perfect. the narrator,1
rajit pimpale : amazing game. lots of things they did new than other games,1
rockroach : while i do very much enjoy the game,1
oddlysilent : this is the best mobile game i have ever played. the high quality,1
kerr vfx : this game is what mobile developers should strive towards creating. the game runs smoothly and looks great,1
yuri gor : it would be cool to add motorbikes. bikes are slim,1
trey miller : one of the best endless driving games i've ever played. good controls.,1
havoc nine : this game is actually quite fun. it's satisfying to drift around corners and to dodge traffic at the same time. only complaint i have is,1
ali safa : pretty cool game,1
yurii kostiv : love the game,1
eric campbell : this might be a good game. i decided to play for free to see if i was willing to purchase it. within the first ten seconds of play time,1
vid matjas : i wouldn't go as far as to say the controls are bad because i have no problem with them. if the environment was more interactable it'd be awesome. by that i mean the fences could be destroyed,0
unused account do not reply : absolutely gorgeous little game. virtually everything works perfectly and it isn't ad heavy in the slightest. some additions i wish to suggest would be a couple of run down versions of cars that you get once you go through perhaps 100 junkyards and more detailed models when you enter picture mode. but to be clear,1
david h : no pay2win; simple but entertaining; varied tracks with funny details; growing rang of cars,1
mitali roy : gonna enjoying driving! i've seen no other driving game which is as awesome as this. beautiful classic cars,1
cosmic eggs : this game is great. the scenery and the difference you can feel in different cars is awesome. and the fonts. the only thing i would add is that when you pause the game,1
noah mifsud : this is a beautiful game with good gameplay and fun mechanics (the drifting is surprisingly cool and rewarding). each location has its own challenges and quirks making what could be a monotonous grind feel consistently engaging. i do wish the different surfaces (snow,1
james hobbs : i've tried this game twice. it's extremely difficult to control. you give a turn left or right it's,1
yogesh agarwal : this game exceeded my expectations. i mean not only there are several cars and maps but you can almost customise any car as well add some coolness to it. the only con i find is after putting game on pause we don't get a countdown for resuming it back which i think is a downfall. also you'll can add some challenges which can be pretty amazing as after finishing all the levels and achievements there's nothing left to do. you'll can even give some rewards for challenges. fabulous game!!!,0
wayne oh : #drive is an excellent time killer. the graphics,1
chutneyperson : very polished experience,1
khan ahnaf tahmid : incredeble graphics & cars,1
jack maguire : easy to get the hang of difficult to master,1
louis louth : an excellent,1
red reign : a great endless driving game and there are some cons but i don't have a complain the grapichs are good too good job,0
santiyesss d. bread : 4 stars because this game has a buttload of potential for a story mode,1
ferrial pondrafi : simple and fun. the low poly style is wonderful.,1
craig : fun for time pass,1
evan brannon : i love this game all the cars the maps and the fact they only have few ads,0
blackout 5x5 : i love the art style and the gameplay is super satisfying,1
cristian cruz : it is very entertaining to play especially if you need a time waster,1
kamsiyochukwu ejeckam : cool game love the cars the physics the graphics its amazing pls could u add a race mode,1
henry sus bro : very fun game love it. an hour passes and i didn't even notice,1
rinku singh : game is good but i have a issue that there is no camera angles when you will add camera angle i will give you 5 stars,0
hamza fuzail : amazing game love it. but i feel a little too many ads,1
david oniceanu : very cool game!! i love the cars and the graphics!!!,1
antonio bertagna : less sensitivity car control like able to drift that the cars,1
coma falca : i really like the game i hope some day you will add visible car damage,1
justin daly : extremely fun,1
nupur gupta choudhury : it is a good game but the cars should be more easier to unlock.,1
jorel williams : it is a very nice game zen mode need some work but very nice,1
spongy leo : a really fun game to play on your free time. i can't find anything wrong with this game.,1
bill clinton : pretty great game,1
tonuzzo nicklefritz : after i got the game i thought it was gonna be boring but it's pretty addictive. not sure what turning coolness on does for a car other than making it look cool. the drifting is a bit annoying to use,1
mr nyan cat tv : this is a great game! would recommend but only a bug where you can go through things in the training ground.,1
arnav waghdhare : loved it until the new update. the new update kind of makes the display screen more flashy than the original simplistic and elegant,1
"alokym creeper : i have few tips. add number overlays over car stats. you will have best of both worlds - precision of numbers and visual size of ""stacks"". drifting mechanic can do unnoticed because it's only usable in one of three control methods. pls solve. i suggest adding more times when you have to choose to refuel or something else (when two stations are adjacent and you can't visit both). this will add choices. if i hit stuff",0
tim : great game. the graphics are amazing,1
c s : updt: i solved the prob with tofuyama not loading (still froze with new patch)... my home router's privacy filter was blocking whatever address the game needed to temporarily connect to. after that,0
zap man : a unique spin on runners. most running games have 3 lanes you travel on with collectables throughout the route and the idea is to get a highscore. this is true of #drive aswell however because we are driving a car you have more freedom of movement and really have a chance to pull off some risky stunts. i think the car physics makes this the best runner game i've played. i also purchased the full version which removes ads and helps to progress faster.,1
adina gojnea : the most amazing game i have ever seen! love the country vintage vibe,1
yakob anggora : the graphic is beautiful,1
biggshiggs : a good game that only came across today and play for about 30 minutes,1
ab sinteta : so far so good. bit of a hassle to get used to the controls but once you get the hang of it its perfectly fine. but there is alack of incentive to play the game and there are is no real progression apart from new cars. maybe add more customisation and upgrades,1
dmitri gonzalez : so for the time being the game does excell in everything apart from the fact that cars cost a ridiculous amount later in and you can only gather caps so fast that it takes an excruciatingly long amount of time in order to buy a damn car. along with the fact that you also can put upgrades on the car with paint jobs even and even those are lackluster at times. i understand that it would be difficult to create more paint jobs for all the cars but you could also just stop making cars.,1
jojonomuskets : i like the graphics of the game,1
brandon lyle : i enjoy it. i would enjoy it more if it were online and could race against other players. more options of cars and different upgrades so that everyone's cars are different. would be better if there were roads that split spots not just one continuous road. and a few other things but it's decent.,1
azril fadzakir : strangely hypnotic,1
dodantheboss : i gotta say,1
ben carson : fun experience,1
eric froese : the physics are weird/not great,0
gerhard scorgie : at first i played it i didn't like it but a couple of months later (now) i actually love it ,1
nanna shafi : nice game but please more stuff like multiplayer/single player racing,1
vwvento schwarz : this game is fantastic! i second ail the praise that everyone else has been showering over this game before me and have zero complaints about the steering. what i wish in terms of game development for the future are more challenges and maybe an artificial intelligence opponent to drive against mode. also,0
ollie keele : a good game but the car is hard to control,1
karthik nair : great visuals and even has a zen mode,1
"mfxm : i was like: ""they want rating? they get rating!"" i think that out of millions of millions of millions of games i've tested this is the most addicting cartoon-style high quality car game i've ever seen. at the point of posting this this i'm grinding for a 20500 cork worth porsche with the coolness mode on.",1
chandni khan : this game is a very good time killing game and the controls are very easy to understand. i just love playing in the zen mode and i would recomment you to play it to. #drive,1
catre 12 : after so many hours i have found a nice game to play playing experience was really fun. and it's got pretty great cars and drive experience. nice job on it.,1
beena purohit : everything is good but i want these things change like choose a map like japan,1
henry norton : so far game is fun,1
xavier mcleod : great graphics. cool range of cars. loads if sick maps. just an amazing game in general and it's really fun to play.,1
aidan maguire : the game used to run flawlessly on my oneplus 7t pro but ever since the recent update the game freezes for half a second constantly,1
blake stepaniak : fun game,1
sebastian spreutels : this game has improved so much since i downloaded it. it's fun,1
lorenzo pizzu : its really fun,1
daniel jones : really fun game! a littoe bit confusing on the controlls and settings but still really fun and satesfying when you're in a bad mood.,1
najdan gazibaric : simple,1
sofronii dimitrov : i love the animation and attention to detail in each map and i love the diversity with each car and obstacle. 10/10 would reccomend.,1
brandon njamba : love the game it has a lot of cars to use,1
paballo01 mabaso : man this game is awesome!!! i like it this game it's even better than asphalt 8 more like information on that game and this game it's cool it has so many fast and furious car and the best part is that you can decared your own dream car my dream car is a mclaren gtr because it's the fastest,1
game on : for some reason the game keeps crashing just before the race begin,1
fuk yu : ads or no ads,0
james strickland : neat game,1
h. wll : pretty good. sometimes you can't see cars,1
wade montgomery : pretty fun overall. just a nice chill out time killer to have fun playing. progression doesn't seem so bad. it's a unique game,1
supersmoothie s : very fun,1
travis mandela : one of the best games out there but i decided to give it 2 stars cause it keeps on stopping for some few minutes during the game and it's annoying,1
npc# 0091 : excellent graphics and concept. horrible controls. the way the car turns is just stupid and unreal. it crashes every now and then. could have been a good game but sadly ruined by poor controls. edit: i don't mean user input. i mean how the game reacts to those inputs. how the car reacts. it just starts drifting. that's not how cars turn. i mean the physics engine is wonky.,0
yure ho : good little game but too hard to control.,1
simone dc : not your usual endless driving game,1
sean schaefer : this is one of the best mobile games i've played in a long time. the endless driving gameplay i very fun and addictive. the game also looks great and the graphics have a lot of character. they also don't shove micro transactions in your face like many other mobile games do and the ads are very short. this is everything a good mobile game should be.,1
matthew g : excellent game,1
oof oof : this is a good game to quickly help you out when you're bored. it sometimes gets annoying,1
ignus amandus : it's a nice game to play if you like to go one forever ,1
dane keling : the game is a great game in itself,1
aleksej alex : great game,1
kristopher walsh : the game is really good as it is,1
the user : of course the game is excellent the way it is,1
"kibbleskid : nice artstyle and fun gameplay. an interesting take on the ""endless runner"" games. reasonable amount of ads. progression feels too slow",1
zacky bibo : it was a nice game,1
alex i : the thing you see from the very beginning: this game is made with so much love! subtle jokes,1
sava arsenijevic : it is really good,1
andy taylor : would be lovely if the brakes worked,1
ryougi ch. : no cloud saves! you can lost the progress and cant restore it,1
ryanthehero : #drive is one of the most unique retro styled games out there,1
jimmy t : please check the game,1
peach eater : graphics are nice but the controls are straight up uncontrollable and difficult,0
snipedude500 : race game with minimal ad,1
daniel somodi : this game is amazing,1
dunialuar : the game is great,1
larry tm : i wish you would take this and make an open world racing game...i am so tired of endless runners. if you do decide to make a racing game don't just make a sprint mode or drag racing-i can't stand those games either-2 to three laps around a well designed track against multiple racers or duel-keep the police chases in too! y'know what? just emulate need for speed underground with this art style and i will love you for life!!! and make it playable offline- that is key to the recipe! the art style!,0
sealand itisi : this game has been pretty good so far. i will admit that i only picked it up because the starting car resembles the trueno,1
satish vishwakarma : this is the most creative game ever !! you will find this game completely unique. there are a lot of new stuff in this game which makes it outstanding. the graphics are exquisite. the cars in this game make it extraordinary. when you play this game,1
lawson doolin : this game is sooo good! i think there should be a sequel that takes place in modern times,1
manikanta g. : this game is fun and hard at the same time. background music and voice is awesome. ads are shown only when you ask for.,1
g matos : love the graphics and the goals,1
dino panliboton : the graphics is phenomenal the and gameplay is challenging,1
vishnu prakash : a lot of reviews talk about the controls,1
mrfixit usa : it's a fun little game but it really needs work on the controls. for those who like the arrow button steering it's probably great. for those of us who want to be able to control the degree of the turn with steering wheel (or even tilt) we are out of luck. and braking needs a dedicated brake button.,0
juan manrique fas : so far pretty good game. there is a lot of cars and there is progression between maps just by playing. same with leveling up which at certain levels it earns you new vehicles. as of now 44 vehicles are in,0
fabian : it's a entertaining game. i like it,1
colin murphy : what an exceptional driving game. superb graphics,1
hasin anik : this game looks amazing,1
glen kabis : the presentation and graphics are some of the best out there. i really want to love this game but i just don't enjoy it at all. the gameplay is a little too simple. i've tried all the control schemes and different sensitivity options but there's just no settings that make it feel fun to play for me. i don't know if the more expensive cars would fix anything either,1
robert pawlik : responsive controls,1
john chiu : the control is garbage. i am not a novice gamer,0
elyar nova : there are a couple of elements which make this game really interesting one of them which personally i really adore are both the graphics and the special difficult controls. like as i've mentioned before there are more specialities in this game but the two i mentioned earlier,0
luis zambrano : this game is great,1
josh ferguson : absolutely love this game,1
"lego star wars jango fett : beatiful game indeed. i love the visuals and it's simple style. the gameplay feels original and there's a great variety of cars to choose from. i like the how the ""cool"" mode looks on every car. i have just started playing and defivinetly recommend it.",1
monika raphtalia asuma : the game is challenging,1
small hiki : its been a while since i've played a game so simple,1
5th uote : i really love this game and the attention to detail has like which side of the road the npc's drive on or the dirt/snow the fly behind your car. or even just the sound of the engine for each of the cars being different. these are all things that make this game different than its competitors. all i have to say is i cant wait for new maps. maybe yall could make one on my island of puerto rico? also one more thing; could you add braking to the controls as well? pretty please?,0
karl nievesson : i love it,1
ethan duncan : nice game,1
ramish anwar : love this game,1
kurameshi yusuke : amazing game,1
anuj jain : the collect options opens up whenever i'm changing the cars. otherwt a great game.,1
damien alvarez : this game is really fun when your bored. it is very entertaining game to play.,1
taylor noel : controls are nice. simple,1
najdah g : great visuals and well played out concept. could use a few more places (countries) to drive through rather than the huge selection of cars.,1
craig seman : has potential but lacks in gameplay and content. to be honest i dont like the controls at all,0
farsme dragonius : overall a good game relly liked it but i will like it so much if the camera angle can be changed like at ground level like in other cad racing games so please add this feature an game is so good nice work,1
mark lukban : it's frustrating and addicting. one of my favorite mobile games. i'd get it for pc and console too if i could.,1
ayushi singh : wow. this game,1
gabriel boston : this game is amazing. the cars are beautifully designed and well done. i love the maps. i do have 2 suggestions. 1: make the photo mode wwwaaayyy less sensitive. 2: i have an idea for a map: bayport. it should be a beach map set in hawaii. those are my suggestions. otherwise,1
yash jha : thank you pixel studios for making such a mind blowing game good graphics in starting controls was tough but after 2 to 3 times i got my hand over it. all locations catches my eyes and attention cars are fabulous. just want to give 1 suggestions that try to give 1st person view just like the driver see from inside the car and let the controls like that only plzz accept my request towards your game. thank you.,0
jason kennedy : great for either a quick game or for relaxing with it for a while. it's fun and challenging trying to get the feel of the different vehicles you can earn. i love playing this game but... the advertisements can be deafening if you have earbuds. i would give 5 stars if i could listen to my own music without risking my hearing,1
vojta kuscak : the controls might be somewhat hard to master but once you get the hang of it,0
bernard yap : been playing this since it launched and it keeps getting better and better. easily one of my top favorites on mobile. love the art style,1
chris lam : great game. would be nice if you could disable dialogue. a time trial version with no coins or powerups for every course would be nice. also racing one on one online would be cool,1
mahesh kumar : i would love it if the roads were more wider. there are so many exciting cars but it is very difficult to earn coins for every vehicle,1
vincent johnson : nice simple pick up and play.,1
friendzoned guy : i'm astonished. this is my best endless racing with low poly tooned car models,1
augustine martins : nice game,1
prasanth kannan : it is a good game,1
iron man : i know everyone was having a great play of this game,1
adam olejniczak : outstanding. takes a while to learn how to drive but once you do it's amazing addictive fun you can jump i and out of. physics are great,1
debasruto maity : if you're looking for a minimalistic themed endless driving game with decent graphics,1
darleen dumaguin : i'm loving it so far. the game looks great,1
emon baruah : one word: sharper turns. okay that's two words. i don't care. the tracks need sharper turns. the drift feature is pretty much useless without it. i unlocked three maps,1
james luciano : like this game but sometimes phone it's so lag because he can't handle bigger gb or mb,0
john frederik alvendia : great game! would suggest to tweak the controls a bit because there are time that you can't steer when throwing doughnuts. but overall an epic car casual arcade. a+ mechanics,1
mr. shungite : it takes wayyyyy too long to get money,1
grimm ii : 10/10. i haven't even gotten past the first 'level' yet,1
coz efekt : this game is perhaps one of the best i've played. if it were on console,1
ian pilsbury : definitely a neat game. was hoping to see a knock off of the 240z,1
nicolas lopez : nice car game. interesting concept... you just drive on the road avoiding obstacles (cabs,1
christopher hill : i couldn't even scroll through the cars without it taking me to the key section after tapping the selection arrow more than once,0
team619 : simply the best arcade plus+ time killer . most of the review about controls . it needs to be fixed . but irecommend everyone to put the control setting to 3rd,0
miguel vargas : its a good time killer. simple too. you just drive straight and try to avoid cars and not run out of gas.,1
marc concepcion : this is a classic arcade game experience! simple game mechanics,1
olivia s. s : overall this game is very great. the control look like easy,1
crystal v : it's great. but the controls are extremely hard,1
brandon eaton : faulty controls that don't always respond,1
naresh motwani : it took too much time to start the drive. crashed within 10 seconds since it was the first time but then immediately 15 seconds ad. uninstalled within 7 seconds of the advert. the overall design including when ads should be pushed,0
ahnaf jamil : not to sound like a bot but.. its almost perfection. music is great,0
harrol bennedict : good graphics,1
giuggi roby : game could be nice,1
sergiy boyarchuk : fun. enjoyable. relaxing. great game what so ever. just... would wanted to ask about adding a bit more cars,1
riel mallorca : this game is sooooo good. you can play it offline,1
sean watson : love this game,1
"wylie s : very smooth racing game with an at times funny story! win for me! edit: tried to pick up again after a bit and it says ""max out coolness"" used up all my caps to try to ""max"" out! won't let me race",1
ball - : great game. got one bug though ( or it is intentional idk) everytime i tap the car selection navigation button too fast/rapidly,1
alex maine : great game,1
nate parker : ok,1
vincent hafford : i like the escape driving games,1
somebody's account : fun,1
timothy j. holloway : this is a good-looking game,1
czack efron : i'll definitely gonna rate this 5 stars!! game is nice and simple controls make it easy and graphics is great but i wish i can skip or change tasks of levels cause i'm stuck with 7th level it's says i need to drift for 5 secs but it's too hard cause it's difficult to find a drifting place pls add those and i'll tell this game to my friends.,1
tree zen : can you make the road in france a little bit bigger? it's too f*****g narrow. what the hell is wrong with those brick walls? just get hit and game over. also,1
miguel creel : this is by far the best driving game that i have found on mobile since 3 years ago. i love this game and i love the variety of cars you can choose from. the controls are very easy to use and have the perfect sensitivity for this kind of game. i do wish that there were more than 4 colors to choose from (i might have just missed a button to show more colors) but this is a great driving game and i recommend it to everyone.,1
_wreckit 101 : great way to kill time and really love the gameplay. saw an earlier comment about losing the dialogue,1
daniel tomlinson : i like the concept of the game alot,1
tylee fontenot : great game doesn't take alot of skill barely any ads and doesn't take long to get new cars,0
nathan ferne : really fun game,1
dominic la trobe : i love this game it's so epic one thing though,1
aditya sharma : the game looks great but that's about it. it would be so much better if they didn't give you the shittiest car possible to keep you engaged in the game. it's so bad. along with the voice annotations at every event are repetitive to the point of being annoying. otherwise,0
surjeetsingh matharu : very nice n intresting game needs little inproments in controle,1
adi ctrl : i would like to zoom in camera,1
bartosz debski : i know its endless driving but games lacks in variety. 2 worlds in and apart from driving in different scenario,1
niranjan rajeev : nice game but hard to control the vehicle,1
chintendo : sensitivity slider needs a number next to it,1
garrett davis : this is a fun game,1
hasan al-haddad : simple gameplay yet very challenging.. best game for killing time but not wasting too much time.. the graphic also eye-catching with awesome animation.. i will buy full version next month.. update 03/07/2020: you lost 1 star due to motion blur.. thx for your attention to fix it,1
xchara fan : it's a very fun game to play when you're bored or just want to play a good mobile game,1
bronosgot : revising 5 star review a bit. #drive is beautiful and lovely but has some frustrating things. drifting is 2 aggressive & doesn't match the curve of most roads without ways 2 adjust on the fly,1
mccloudy : such a chill game. the in-game transactions are really in-expensive too.,1
benjamin fraser-macfarlane : this game is fantastically simple. elegant ui,1
adedimeji sebiotimo : great game,1
mrzangarra : steering is a bit arcady but still better than most casual games where you just switch lanes. overall pretty calm racing game,1
hector rivera : has very high potential... i think you should have roads that go left and right as well with maybe some ramps on the sides of the roads as well to give a little more atmosphere and challenge but other then that controls work good for me but maybe not for everyone idk if there is a different steering option but maybe add a booster throughout the road to speed boost from cops to give that chance in higher levels but giving higher risk of crashing as well for enhanced challenge. at that would be 5,0
lucian : awesome! good graphics good game play,1
jiraiya hermit : fantastic experience. all the cars are within affordable capacity and may all be unlocked just by persistent playing. all the maps are distinct. highly reccomend. all i request is more colour schemes,1
roberto gondrong : controls are somehow annoying,0
patrick ahad : great way to pass time,1
sean riley hawkins : according to the reviews the game is good and on point,1
alvin brillo : i really love the graphics. its so cute! only gripe is the game is too hard. or maybe im just to noob to play the game. and the grind is too hard. making purchasing another car almost close to impossible. maybe lower the prices of cars? or make getting coins easier. :),1
marcy upp : this game is a classic and a classic that never seems to disappoint me,1
ian stanley : i'll give it 4 star but i would give it a 5 if you could fix the glitch on level 11 where it says do a 5 second consecutive drift,1
"sitki can t : this is the only game i have written feedback to. the gameplay is lovely and the art piece is on point. driving is fun. but content-wise it is lacking. make the maps transform in themselves. add some challenges to the gameplay. the cops are nut fun. maybe you can add something like highway to where police is notorious. make some active bonuses to the ""huge red question marks"". i hope you do well",0
sinviper : overall,1
racer gaming : very good game but we would like to customize our cars by adding bumpers ,1
ryan morrison : fun game lots of cars gud controls and gud graphic,1
monitor : great and love the graphics. can't expect anything else,1
brian lee : well not play yesterday..,1
rinata 39 : i have to say,1
madhavtamilan1 : a good game,1
"dudeman brochief : it's a solid game if you're into the ""left/right tap"" landscape type game. it's got mario-quality timing. this game could be less ad-intrusive",1
saayam chowdhury : if u don't like this game for its controls,1
joe perez : the cars look nice and the graphics,1
devin carter : it's pretty good. gets boring after a while though. i can see the vehicle parts and some of them ain't even attached in the right places. the game sometimes freezes a little bit and makes me lose when i am making a lot of distance. please fix and add more content. thank you!,0
ankit kumar r. : brakes should not have time limit thats annyoing,0
luca benvenutto : greatest mobile driving game ever available for free,1
prithvi_ raj : wow what a perfect game. this is my all time favourite game. it has many cars. plenty of upgrades and you can chose colors too. i will want to suggest two things 1) like you have mini cars,1
flynn patinkin : great game only complainy is that the mechanics are a little weird,1
jamie bainbridge : good idea but unenjoyable execution. needs auto centre so you don't just skate from side to side all the time. fuel and other side exits need to be more obvious because they're hidden amongst the busy scenery,0
ah h : good old simple driving game remenicent of the days gone by. graphic design is great,1
ahmed noushad : loved everything about it. just the controls a littlr bit clumay. i guess that's part of the game? but a little better control could be hoped for. everything else,0
mike buckley : ok game but i hate that it's using the gyroscope and the ads are oversized so i can't clear them. it's very annoying to have to exit out of the app and reopen it to pass the ad... and that just clears the round progress. not pleased. set a movable safe zone and disable the useless gyroscope,0
shirapthi kaushik : nice graphics. good collection of cars. more creative maps can be added.,1
rob marks : this is a great game but i'm reviewing because i hope the developer will see this: the drift mechanic is never added to my score! on level 15,1
akogwu p johnson : the game is nice the graphic is good and also the control work's perfectly.i just like the game.,0
jake chadwick : the road markings for the uk map are wrong,1
david prior : a cute but uninspiring game. many cars and maps to unlock,1
jsh strke : i quite like the graphics and the styling of the game,1
brandon f : i have lots of fun playing this game! i enjoy its art style and driving physics. its seems easy to play,1
greg wheeler : #drive has been made with some love. the artwork is full of humour,1
lazaros : i don't normally write reviews but this is an exceptional game. minimal ads,1
undeademon : it's alright. it's a good game to play while you wait for imminent death. it's not like there's any reason to play games. we're all gonna die in the end anyways. i wish there's a way you can connect to your gmail or facebook account so you could play this on your other devices while keeping your progress. i also hope the developers add a way to disable the voice over but keep the in-game audio.,0
t woods : i've been a loyal player since you dropped this game and it's literally the only driving game i'll download whenever i get a new phone. i love everything about this game and the mechanics behind it. i also appreciate how 8-9 times out of ten y'all add a new car and/or map! my only thing two suggestions would be to add a ghost chaser mode (if that makes sense) and to add two cars- '95 toyota mr2 and a apollo s gumpert :d otherwise keep it up the great work! i hope to see those cars one day,1
riesta gema : it's a fun game. another kind of driving game experience,1
not pixl : love the game's style,1
andy vargas : this game looks just so gorgeous! and its so much fun! really well artistically planed! should ad more dramatic/spectacular crashes,1
lactose intolerant : managed to pass my boring time somehow. the control are equally insane i like it,1
zila the man : best game ever,1
omkar sawant : there a bug in the game,1
krzysztof setlak : i'm honestly impressed with the quality of the game. it's simple,1
"nothing : it's really a great game and the idea of this game ia really great hats off to you ""the developer"" just one thing the controles ",1
zbarba : this is an amazing mobile game. incredibly entertaining,1
bobaggins gameing : fun game just some anoying adds here and there,1
christopher gibson : absolutely gorgeous graphics... easy to play,1
v. sankaran venkatesan : a really nice driving game.,1
noah hildenbrand : nice game. but it's hard to play and i die a lot,1
ethan irvin : very good game! not hard to get the hang of,1
vignesh rathnam : not so good for controls,1
arlene grice : it's a good game,1
shannon goodwin : i like that you can drive like it is an arcade game but i'm hoping not too much car will cost alot of coins in the game,1
nik conley : review updated now that i have more play time under my belt. the game is ok. big selection of cars,1
krutarthxo : so good graphics but trash gameplay. most of players wont even invest unless it has a goal to be achieved rather than mindlessly just playing same map for just cars and chasing around bottle caps. also controls are totally wack and car wobbles so much that cant be controlled while drifting. i just hate this level end system when you crash or damage the car.,0
cheryl n : it's an amazing game plus i can drift in the tofuyama map in japan!,1
antonio dias : it's hard to find some good games on thing store unless you go to top rated,1
onkar singh : i like this game very much. but the only problem was that it didn't have any damage increasing option at all.since their is no quick way to see all the missions we have to do when we pause the game until we don't get out. come on give some changes to this game and also this game is 2019 winner . at last their is son many drifts. congrats for 2019 winner,0
carl cashman : good game plain and simple. graphics are perfect for this being a fun game and i like the controls once you get used to them. a lot of things to achieve and vehicles to buy so you won't get bored or clock it too soon. i'd like to see a little more customisation options like wheels or more of a colour palette in future updates,1
xander thompson : the controls are simple,1
a google user : i want to love this game. the art is gorgeous,1
theo damasio-razafiarizaka : +initial d and other cutural stuff references +good graphics,1
- nameless nomad - : i've played this game on and off for the past year or so,1
thefrkoby : this games is the perfect game for you when you do not have internet,1
kaji thatotherguy : great fun! light on battery,1
king ironfist : #drive is a fun driving game. i enjoy plowing through cars as i'm sliding through the towns. excited and hopeful to see new towns pop up and possibly new power ups? visually appealing and the controls are simple. thanks for the game. could you maybe add a town with holes in the road or like ramps... :),1
hand : entertaining and fluid pretty good if you ask me and i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes endless runners.,1
thisisathreat : great game. thats plain. but i found a glitch where when you die and are offered a revive if you watch a video,0
equaals : this game is pretty fun and cool the graphics are great it's just what i needed but the reason i'm giving it 4 stars is because when i want to brake and turn and i can't then i miss one of the stations or something could you solve the issue by maybe adding the brake somewhere else or double tapping right and holding to brake but honestly this game is great and a you yes you person looking at reviews... just try the game it's great :d,0
shaik sazeer : loved the game but ads are bit annoying please reduce ads and i was very much impressed with the graphics what it have. it would be better if you add some other camera view for this game ,0
poki imane : edit 2: down a star,1
stnewts : fix the controls already!!! this game shows so much promise but the controls completely ruin that,0
gaming titan : this game is a great driving game with cool voice-lines and good attention to detail on the maps! the only thing i would say is that the maps get boring and repetitive after a while so you have to save up postcards for a new one for a while. other than that,1
md hasibur rahman : this game is extremely bad because of control the graphics and gameplay is good . it is frustrating to control the car,1
danny kime : its a pretty decent game. i like the scenery and the challenge of driving through a gas station is risky yet rewarding. the controls are ok but i dont like how the camera moves with the car. apart from that,1
robin timms : cool game. looks and sounds amazing. a classic old school style driving game.,1
stephen jacques : i discovered this game by pure chance on social media and thought it had nice aesthetics...but assumed it might have been a switch or xbox game,1
rafky fauzan : simple,1
2kaysavage : great game,1
nicholas abel : only got to tutorials,1
william cheng : fun,1
rowen krampf : good looking graphics,1
mike clarke : solid game to play on the loo at work. though a very soothing game to play,1
alessandro celoro : this was easily the best game on the app store for me,1
real gamer 20 : very very relaxing game,1
aarif iqbal : simply beautiful. apart from the stunning visuals,1
elisey rodriguez : strange but in garage: when you're trying to tap fast to switch cars,0
a grave misunderstanding : for a game about evading the police and speeding,1
pete : really good graphics,1
hamza anjum10 : i would rate it 5 if the developers will add gyroscopic control in the game... however the graphics are ok.,1
nicholas martin : love gfx,1
shin jon : best game great graphics and nice background music overall great game. love this game and it's developer who has created this game..,1
pouya mohtat : carefully crafted. gameplay and graphics are great and i love the classic theme going on and the humorous dialogue. the only thing keeping it from being a 5 star game is the limited items and power ups that makes it a little repetitive. also why can't we control the car using the phones gyro??,1
aaron paul leabres : i have only one thing to criticize. the size or the proportion of the car. correct me if i'm wrong but i think when i first downloaded and play this game,1
shivam : graphics are awesome,1
kai tyas : great driving app,1
chris basso : super entertaining game with a beautiful soundtrack/themes that compliment the fantastic graphic style used! however,1
nkado harrison : the controls are a little iffy,1
anshul patel : this is a fun free to play with some small issues that can and will eventually become annoying. play for the fun off it while it lasts. pros - - +great graphics +fun cars + large variety +easy to pickup cons - - -wall tend to be difficult to learn and have many parts where crashing out is unexpected -controls are easy to pick up but can be annoying to use especially with the 1st issue -roads don't really fit the drift mechanic,1
edward sutton jr : awesome game first of!! fantastix job devs! however,1
a 1 : it's a beautiful game but controls need major fixing.. could be an amazing & profitable game if dev wasn't too greedy and making the car ridiculously sensitive... i'm crashing into something every 2 seconds. guess one of the ways you can revive though? look at crossy road as an example of a beautiful game,1
dylan alton : hahaha,1
ravnil raj : the game is aoewsome coz the graphics suits the game but there is a problem where there is no upgration of cars n there r not enough cars to play with,1
arya rovana : gorgeous game,1
clanline35028 : its a great game,1
jessie jay nemeno : its a really nice game. atmospheric and relaxing but one thing that puts me off is the lack of motion control in a driving game. touch controls can get too sensitive and make the car hard to control.,0
daniel marton : perfect example of easy to learn hard to master games. easy controls and in-game tasks,1
good question : i would say in my opinion its a good game the retro style and easy to grasp controls the game is nice.its one of those games that you only play for a little while before uninstalling but sometimes you keep the game for a bit longer and it starts to feel good.all around good game with nice graphics easy controls and retro design.,1
aaron volcic : game is very well designed,1
brody miller : something is wrong with this game. i download different games all the time. i downloaded this one not too long ago. right after it was done,0
raditya arga putra : i swear to god,1
reid johnston : controls are not intuitive or simple. in fact none of the steering options make any sense. graphics are bright and interesting. after the first crash an ad pops up that you can't back out of.,0
anmol sharma : the best game i have ever played on android,1
dylan milne : this game is surely made by boomers. cheesy 80s style. unnecessary voice acting from an unknown character. repetitive gameplay. have to get into debt to unlock cars at a reasonable rate and progress. vertigo racing and the pako games are much better than this. their gameplay is fun and progression is steady. boomer game.,1
zagreb boris : nice game,1
nandan singh : this is a fine masterpiece with a few issues. however,1
yuka [gd] : this game is good and chill i like the car physics and the graphics of the game it looks simple but the shadows color makes it more good the control is easy but there's is a bug at tofuyama map,1
rodney lanning : really fun game,1
joshua griffin : can barely play the game because of all the long 30 second ads. i can understand needing to have afs in a free version but this was way too much. i uninstalled immediately. great graphics and gameplay for the little time that i could play it.,0
"xia sales : i thought it was open-world because it says ""endless driving"" and guess what? it's not. it's technically ""endless driving"" because you can retry multiple times",0
aituar kenges : i have enjoyed the graphics,1
mccrazy 23 : it's not a bad little driving game but the controls are beyond sensitive even at the lowest setting,0
ashutosh anand : excellent game . 4 stars cause of limited gameplay ,1
anastasia bielievitina : this game has such a smooth graphics,1
rafaim regis : graphics is promising. i feel like this game would be perfect for guys like me who seek classic games. but the controls are really hard. so i uninstalled it. i hoping for an update on your controls. that way i might wanted to install it again.,0
manpreet singh : good,1
loading _ : apart from the backseat driver this game is a great passtime and good for friendly competition to see how far you can go,1
adarsh : this game is super fun,1
bravebear 2 : has decent graphics for the game quality. the controls are a bit rough,0
cj imperial : easily one of the greatest games for mobile great sounds great cars great graphics it's just so perfect. i'll say though that it gets grindy but it's kind worth in my opinion the controls are simple too. i hope you continue developing this game. and take some rest.,1
ryan tirtajaya : i've played for 5mins and i feel the quality of the game is worth to pay to remove ads. ads are really long,1
keanu edgar novicio : this game is really good! 4 stars because the latest map has too many hindrance in the road and it's a little bit tight compared to other maps. and looking forward for more new maps and cars,1
cher maleking : maybe one of the best games in this genre. the graphics are really amazing and stylish. the gameplay is so smooth. a lot of cars to choose from. just remember that the brakes in this game are more precious than the brakes in any other car games lol. good luck devs. keep the good work up.,1
hendrik prinsloo : hey guys,1
elijah vincent : now this is what a good free game should be! especially with the inclusion of zen mode! more games like this please! no more garbage like gardenscapes scamming you with their false and shady advertisments! the only time you see ads are when you aren't playing and i,1
alex sandoval : horribly tedious. i turned down the sensitivity to it's lowest possible variable and i still had trouble controlling the car. when your game is a simple touch left to turn left,0
saltyboytyler : its a pretty good time killer and a ton of cars for you to unlock. i dont like the steering part as much since to use the brakes you have to hold both sides and sometimes the game steers to one side instead of stopping(when brakes are already cooled down),0
ohm vyas : very minimalistic yet stylish game with great features and reasonable advancements. although there r many ads,1
mohammad asghar syed : the motion blur added in the new update for high graphics gives me motion sickness,0
frederick nicholas : nice app,1
deadsphere : this game appeared cool at first,1
michal linke : it's a really great endless... driver. tons of cars to unlock,1
dog fucker : i really enjoy this game,1
shikhar garg : this is a wonderful game with minimalistic graphics and nice look and feel with comments coming through the journey. plus the motion thing in the garage is just amazing . never seen anywhere else. 3 cheers to the development team and all others who have worked on it,1
box horridge : the graphics are neat. i like the look of the game. i saw some comments that said it was too hard. if you adjust the sensitivity on the steering you should be good. super fun. great job thanks for all the effort put in. it's one of 2 games on my phone. i dig it.,1
blue kamel : the game concept and graphics are excellent but 2 mayor flaws in my opinion: 1) controls are so bad,0
mocha : simple driving game and the drifting is fun. the compulsory ads are quite irritating and i paid to get rid of them. there should be more rewards with objectives to make players stay with the game,1
atte jamsen : great game,1
adam cornette : decent pace,1
"erik choong : nice little time killer. gives you that ""one more time"" kind of feeling. plenty of cars to unlock. but upgrading doesn't quite make any difference to the vehicle that is noticeable. still",1
anonymous : the control...your steering wheel is controlling the rear wheels not the front. so when you turn left,0
surya kiran ss : absolutely superb.this game will give you a cute and unique gameplay experience!! each map is crafted carefully and extremely detailed. that soothing voices gives a special kind of pleasure when driving the car. car garage is also endless!! plenty of cars with special features and styles would never make you feel bad try it. my fav.,1
pratik anand : brilliant. it's just brilliant. free-to-play,1
zord r. : #prettyhard to learn to #drive properly. at the beginning,1
j brown : not fun? it's the easiest way to describe it. controls are ,1
jason patrick : absolutely loving this little endless driver! the visuals are top notch and hearken back to the days of auto modellista. each car handles differently which makes unlocking new vehicles feel like more than just a visual upgrade. highly recommend!,1
robert : honestly,1
oliver kuusmann : looks cool,1
the moover : ive played this game before and it was awsome. i just was wondering though if u could have a racing mode because i think the cars would look great next to each other. have it same style and bit like fpv racing but samw style you have already with the racing aspect. the game looks amazin i just wanted to see you guys take it to that next step.,1
ratan mani debbarma : overall nice. make the gameplay fullscreen and let the fuel meter be on the gameplay screen instead of having a black bar. framerate is nice,1
joshua wright : really fun time waste with a ton of cars and upgrades. its really lacking in a story or purpose other than driving. maybe like a rags to riches,1
yogify : nice .... great game. i liked those arrow controls ... would be nice if u could add some more sterring modes like ( tilt,1
jeff jeffson : listen,1
jason pravic : i used to have a 5 star for this game but since the new update i can't even open the app. i tap the icon it flips to the load up screen then goes back to the home screen all on it's own. i've restarted my phone multiple times and i've redownloaded the app multiple times. i can't play this game and i'm pretty tight about it.,0
banjo booker : the gameplay is simple yet rather fun,1
bloatedgopher : ads are a bit bothersome if you are looking for a strickly free game,1
spencer beckett : really cool graphics and gameplay. only things i would tweak are the voiceovers and the braking system. sometimes the brakes seem like they don't work or they wear out too fast. just a little confusing,0
a google user : this game is good,1
bowen nace : i understand the point in this game is to handle a car that is hard to control. but in order for a game like this to be good,1
maxim jones : the game was fine. i didn't like the new indicators but i got over it. now,1
jain jegi : well....it was a totally different experience i liked the interface,1
aleksander stojanowski : game is really nice,1
art deco city architecture : there are games that care,1
martin : typical bad cash grab unity game. using unity,1
juicy gaming : the graphics are cute controls got the sniff. but three stars because the controls are chunky and tap the side for a second longer and your cars going to start drifting. please fix this. i gave it three stars because i like the gane very much.,0
pecodepiso : like the game and the style of the game. but there's a bug where the mission cannot be completed. like in my case,0
mavis aboagyewaa ayeh : i would have given this game a total straight-out five star rating but it keeps on returning to home screen when i open it just at the final stage of loading. i sent it to another phone and its working but it did the the same thing and later worked so i think its a thing with the game please give me some feedback on what to do cause i really love it,0
p c : what a great game. performance on mid range devices is awesome,1
aditya sugandhi : this is actually a quite relaxing driving game experience with decent gameplay and unique commentary that keep things interesting for a while! and i absolutely dig the style and graphics too,1
mira valdez : a great offline game when you're bored. loved the voice acting and the graphics. the bgm fits the aesthetic as well. the animation is very smooth and the ads don't bother you that much. one of the best driving games i've played so far.,1
darkray8000 : extremely fun game to play. the art and graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is very smooth. it's fun and enjoyable to explore the maps and drive the cars considering purchasing the removal of ads if the price was to go down a pound. (3.49 is a bit too much),1
mistwraith : game is fun. controls are a bit sensitive to start with,1
m chadwick : it's a really fun game and nice to have on your phone to kill some time. the only reason it has 3 instead of 4 stars is because i am stuck at lvl 12 and it hasn't moved for days of playing so there is that bug. in addition it would be nice to have a larger 'practice area' but as is even with the bug it is a great game.,0
owen shipp : left and right steering buttons. press both to brake. icons warn you of parking lots to slown for so you can drift through a drive through collecting gas. repairs. mystery upgrades and donuts to throw at cops to distract them. fun dialog. the game is good. if you like music tiles. or subway surfer. you might like this one too.,0
tejas singh : this game is amazing!! literally every aspect of it is perfect- the controls,1
winston blue : great gameplay,1
axel caron : so far the best game i ever installed on my phone. cool graphics,1
"raunak : i payed for the ""unlock all perk"" and i'm very glad i did",1
brictius sancti : epic little game will keep u smiling when u are offline. awesome graphics. awesome controls. drive to unlock your favorites among a huge selection of iconics cars from the 60's,1
frank adele : a very nice game with a great concept but the controls are really whack! very whack! i advice the developers to maybe use tilt controls to make it easier for users because the steering controls don't cut it at all!!!,0
charles biddle : originally a one star. now the game is probably one of the best driving games i've played in the app store. below is my original complaint. i have a galaxy s8 and the game just flat out won't load up. i want to try. it looks like a blast but i can't even get to a start menu or anything.,1
peanut butter hulk : i was playing for a day or 2 at school super fun. got home and turned up the volume to hear the worst voice lines and sound effects. it could be better without all those dumb things the driver says. it has good physics's and it's fun to learn but that's just so cringe lol,0
headcase gaming : this game has charm out the wazoo. usually i'm not a big fan of endless runner games,1
h utusan tuhan : for such an endless runner game,1
remodox : actually quite fun. passes the time really well,1
brian stephan : this game is awesome. i'm having issues purchasing the unlock all cars and tracks. nothing happens when i tap the price button. i would like to purchase the unlock all cars and tracks.,1
cmdr lekroil : the gameplay is cool ,1
penpen vader : the experience and the idea was good,1
thomas k : the graphics are nice. the concept looks interesting. the controls are nit really good. i haven't used a car in real life that was behaving like that. i think you should be able to use brake more.,1
shakeel thomas : it is a fun game,1
onkar nirmale : gorgeous graphic design and graphics... scenamatic view gives an immersive feel. controls could be refined along with some more involving missions or tasks in the gameplay. vehicle visual upgrades and powerups would be a nice feature to have.,1
astro penguin : this is a well made game. super fun,1
jako : great game,1
nigel yong : the game controls are all squishy,1
the best : i love the physics of the game.. it almost feels realistic but in an authenic arcade game way.. i just wish they had a specific button for brakes instead of tapping both sides of the screen.. that would improve the game play a lot..,0
kristijan koprivnjak : stellar game,1
philip benz : i'm not good at this. if i were a little younger i think i could. i can barely pass the 2 min mark and then i crash. but i'm persistent because i like the game. it has an 80's vibe to it and it's worth keeping. if you could slow it down a notch in the first rounds that would be awesome.,1
conner sheckells : it's a relitivly simple game and it's a really good time killer. one thing i think could use some improvement is the car selection menu. maybe have a way to look through a list.nither than that i really like the game.,1
sorrowlord78 : i think the graphics are awesome,1
sapna sahi : i just cut the one star for the dissatisfaction from the zen mode . pls do something so that we can restart just after getting crashed and not need to restart the whole drive and that crash menu dose t appears. if we leave that it's probably the best or second best leisure game i have played . great work guys,0
faris f.i frs : great ! the graphics are good,1
kendrick louis soto : i really like the graphics and since i like turtles can you pls add turtles and also if there is no deep car customization like design the seats add the decals in your way change the steering wheel the calpires and also if there are body kits on the cars that would be very nice and also for your starter money i would like 1000$ that would be great and if all the bugs were gone i would ultimately appreciate that and thank you for reading this recommendation of the game thank you once again.,0
discovering soul : it is really fun to play as it helps me to chill while driving one of the oldest cars in history. it is really nice to drive a classic car in different locations and to enjoy it so much. keep up the good work and add more classics. i would have given you five but photo mode is a bit laggy so that is why.,1
amir adhamy : great little game. metrics and rewards are a bit off though,1
aditya kumar : bro who the hell has made the controls. man they are disgusting. no one can play it properly with that kind of controls. graphics are amazing. all about the game is awesome except the controls. please fix it man...,0
big noob : trying to find a specific car in this game is hell the numbers are all over the place and don't make sense and whenever you switch too many times between the cars it sends you to the collect tab with all the car keys i suggest you remove this feature all together and add a feature where if you click on the car name in the collect tab you get directly sent to the car itself.,1
coffee soup : the game is great it runs smooth but if only the level up system did not just give you vans. also every so often there will be a part when the game skips a frame and i end up dying sometimes. overall great timer killer,0
jl p : the dev's broke the game,1
angelos stavropoulos : amazing. i had so much fun and although the game is simple it gets so hard after a while. i like the missions and that the game has soo many cars and the option to upgrade them. it is simple but awesome 100/10,1
jan loven del rosario : this game is great! my statement on july 2019. now,1
guus lammertink : an amazingly fun gaming experience on mobile. the driving feels good,1
nic q : pretty darn cool infinite racer,1
duck lord : one of the best games ive ever played! love the mechanics and the lovely,1
john carlo sarmiento : i love the game because this is not the other driving games that exploring the road to collect coins ,1
alwin baiju : i love how the graphics is there is a wide variety of cars i suggest the developers just one thing never add other cars just add the vintage ones. the graphics are the best i love how the game is designed and how the cars and maps are displayed the colour combination on the display is classic and i love it.. want the developers to create more games,1
epyon akashiya : a great endless driving game i have played. the grinding of caps are not hard because there is a location that can grind for it. the musics on each countries are really fitted. my suggestion is when there is a chase make sure there is damage received by player car if the cop hits the player car (when it forgets to get doughnut).,1
that kyler : awsome. very fun and addicting game,1
zack metcalf : as a general rule,1
nintendo4dudes : one of my favorite games i have ever played on my phone! the grafics,0
dragoon 223 : this has got to be the best mobile racing game so far. great graphics,1
dwaipayan vidyanta : my experience with the app was wonderful. although i would love to see the transition between day and night and also weather changes. hope you guys would make a racing game with similar graphics,1
teo stavridis : simply the best mobile driving game. a variety of cars you can use by collecting caps,1
gl1tch : who's behind this game ? i'm amazed... this is phenomenal! the art style is crazy,1
lukasz wrzeszczynski-siuda : it has great potential and amazing aesthetics,1
raiza augusto : it's a good game,1
szymon gorgon : it is a really simple game but it manages to pull you into it because of how fun it it. i have never seen a game so simple yet so creative. i recommend this game to people who like driving games with a bit of challenge. the devs of this game are one in thier kind (amazing).,1
josh smith : i think this is a hidden gem in progress. i've been playing for a while and have unlocked a few cars.. it needs more content like a drift mode or something you can earn more caps with. and what the other guy said add some motorbikes... could make a wicked game. keep up the good work,0
a google user : absolutely stunning really enjoyable and one of it's kind. the gameplay is dope and visually very satisfying to look at still could use a little tweaking here and there but apart from that i'd say it's a must play title!,1
ahmed ali : #drive is a beautiful game. lovely game,1
delraj kaur : this is a sparkling game however there aren't many options to choose from such as different vechicles interior angles. the game does not have flexibility because there is not cocked view of many players which is intensely upsetting for new and upcoming players in the game. when i played the game the vechicles play up too much that i begin to get bad migraines in my head. the game should be redeveloped from ground-down again. the fresh update would bring a lot of surprise to all people's......,0
mayank pandey : why do i see ads even after paying to get rid of them. i want to rate it 5 stars because its a great app and keeps me occupied. i was happy to pay for it as a thank you to developers and had no ads,0
somesh : the perfect game ,1
edin v : too hard to steer. packed with long ads. annoying. i found that i had an easier time learning to drive a real car than to drive this drive thing. a gas station pops up,0
ian deaton : great game for he ads get in the way a little but you can just turn off internet if the get in the way too much. other than that the controls are a little weird and the camera angles could be better but other than that it's pretty great.,0
mike bardell : pretty simple game. takes a bit too long to move on to different levels without paying,1
tistan 01 : this game isn't really good. you see,1
dane sorensen : i've really enjoyed this game. my goal was to get a hover conversion delorean (hoverion?),1
christopher niewiadomski : why are you forcing 30 second ads when there are such things as banners?? ffs,0
ranger : it's really good but it would be a great if u could set the camera angle a bit lower & closer to the car,1
ajin p jseph : i bought all the cars and unlocked all maps before they revamped the entire ui and now when i come back to this game after a long time i feel like the controls are not as good as it used to be and the the car turns too much despite lowering sensitivity.,0
huzefa : like playing the game a nice mini touring game,1
aaron ainscow : it's a good game but pisses me off that you can crash into walls go over bumps but if you hit a car your car blows up needs fixing or be able to upgrade your cars damage and the game would be better if it had a break because when there is 2 car coming there no way you get past,0
afendi mohd nor : nice game,1
model3113 : ads are too frequent. 30 second unskippable video for about 20 seconds of gameplay. the actual game is just a grind with nothing original worth sticking around for. graphics are nice,0
coffeine ssound : looks much better,1
disint - official : love playing this and listening to some 808. keep adding cars and maps and stuff! i only just got it and i have a ton of stuff to unlock,1
thanos kitsakis : one of the best mobile racing games there is! beautiful graphics,1
sadra rezaee : hands down one of the best mobile games out there. artstyle is unique and beautiful,1
muhammad yousuf : 3 stars because i dont get the point of this game. vontrols are funky. seriously,1
tim karabet : i love the creativity. the names and logos of the cars are great. the only things that need improvement are maybe some more maps,1
gerald lepage : great arcade driving game with retro-ish flat poly shaded style. easy to collect coins,1
kevin d : a lot of variety integrated into the gameplay. on the next version i would add a view like most racers use,1
daniel furster : not many games get me back after the first try. this one did! pretty fun and addictive so far. i like that the ads are not over the top. the presentation of this game is above average. great graphics style.,1
jesus christ : look the game is really really good. has a bit of comedy to it. but the cars drive like an out of control riding lawnmower and thats being generous. idk. backwards 5 stars. maybe. tilt controls would have been a plus and dashboard visuals.,1
dave kasuma : it was a simple game but was very entertaining,1
craig olson : the game has a few quirks,1
oz oz : repetitive...and ads that last for 30 seconds,0
"yavor rashev : man this became an instant classic for me the moment i started playing. the developers relly put their hearts into this one. love the vibes and the engine. even brought back childhood memories as some of the old cars can sometimes be spotted around my city today and we used to own the ""wego"" from the game back in the 90s.",1
john doe : simple but time consuming game. graphics and cars are unique and well done. possibly add new bonus features like funky graphics and add ons for cars,1
jocknines : pretty good game so far,1
brian ernst : google play connecting is bugged,1
helo : good game. good graphics but i suggest that you could add more urban maps similar like the japan map. also,1
travis koon : it was recommended to me through reddit,1
pickle green : this game is very difficult i think of you made the driving speed slower than it would be better. it is very hard to turn and all the turns you have to do on the road are to tight. i think if you made the roads thicker it would be way easier. this game is very difficult however the graphics are lovely it appears to be very friendly.,1
6-thu hao : good game bc is like high quality and some stuff,1
rip this account : the visuals are beautiful. controls are interesting but aren't difficult at all. it sucks that you get a game over after bumping into a fence or the back of the car,0
etheria galaxia : downloaded the game and bought the 4.99 pack to remove ads and give currency. that was fine until i opened the game again to find that all my purchased currency was gone,1
alexander russell : really good game,1
"david : the graphics are decent . the car wrecks out to easy . but what makes this game one star game is the controls . this game with ""tilt steering"" !! might be fun. there is so much over stear it is almost impossible to drive . once you turn a little bit",1
avery spencer : i played when it very first came out and hated it. now,1
m : a control layout where you have steering on both sides of the screen while having the option to place a dedicated brake button where ever you like would be nice. also the option to play my own music would be appreciated,0
thew t : while it can feel a little repetitive since it is just driving,1
rob bob : pretty fun and great game to pass time *pro tip adjust the sensitivity down when u first start playing unless ur good with it. spent a couple bucks for some coins right off the bat! bought what looks like the mustang and a map. not bad fella's,1
chris deacon : super fun endless type game. tons of different cars to choose from,1
pranav trivedi : it automatically assumes that i have a gamepad somehow. i can't control the car at all,1
kai koski : great game,1
anthony garmont : i want to like this game... but the controls are way too hard. the lack of real brakes makes the gameplay frustrating. if the controls were more like a touchpad where moving your finger side to side steers the car... that would be much better. kinda sucks the way it is now.,0
brian von seggern : annoying 30-second ad forc ed periodically but other than that it's fairly fun. not much for a plot or change of pace other than driving down a single route but the graphics are good and it's free so i can't complain too much,1
proud infidel : basic game that has sweet cell shading graphics. not into the run type games but i do enjoy this game especially when you can do a little drifting and watch that dust fly. simple controls. not much to it but making sure you don't get too crazy in traffic. great time killer.,1
daniel bogeholz : quite fun and very enjoyable. earning any of the currencies such as postcards to get more levels is quite grindy and somewhat difficult but besides that its a very solid game. graphics are incredibly good and surprise me every time i fire up this game,1
yolo sutirtho : its nice..i loved it but i didnt gave 5 stars because after playing for a while it gets boring. now the reason why it gets boring is 1) there are no challenges,0
typical fish : the controls are absolute trash. not just because your controls are original doesn't mean it's good. it's so hard to control and very slidy; another thing it's very laggy. the first time i opened the game it crashed already and when i finally entered the game it's so laggy and the buttons wouldn't even work so please update the game fix thw bugs and the whole entire game,0
renz quindala : hmm. the braking thing is kinda worthless touching both sides and not being able to steer. also making a pitstop is very hard because it has only one speed. but the graphics are great,0
drpumpkin : its fun and i i haven't come across any bugs so far. the cars are nice but i wish there were more veichle upgrades such as spoilers and wheels. other than that the driving is fun and easy to get used to.,1
fam solorzano : very fun game. easy to just play a few minutes at a time. only time you have ads is when you want to revive after a crash or get bonus coins after youre done. you xan actually play without ever seeing an ad!!!,0
mr rjb : this game is just phenomenal,1
jf designers : greatest endless runner i've ever played,1
tomek styn : it's art style is very unique. i like the overall experience. it's responsive but drifting may be a little counter-intuitive... no way to counter-steer during a drift.,1
makan : at start its slow on speed but if you upgrade your ride its get fun. upgrades,1
shibacki : this game is phenomenal. so much effort with maybe 1 ad (that's skippable) every 5-10 minutes. there's so much effort,1
brandon sweat : beautiful and iconic but just empty and repetitive. i had sunk quite a bit of time,1
cortnie h. : it's a fun game,1
eriel plazo : it's good for an game,1
nelson omekke : great graphics,1
asap_alex3 punay : this game is class and most of the time keeping things simple shows how good a game can be and this is a perfect example: has nice controls,1
riley brannan : very smooth and simple,1
aidan schreiner : i've only played for about 3 hours or so total thus far but ive enjoyed it so far. new cars are kind of pricey so there is a grind but nothing is unattainable. as far as these sorts of games go its really well done and a lot of fun!,1
jose zero vallejo : the only game i enjoy from time to time,1
ricardo maciel : played for 5 minutes. about half of that was watching unskippable ads. also the controls are not the best. having to press both left and right to brake was not working well for me most of the time.,0
jason : enjoyable game. simple concept,1
wayne smail : beautifully simple,1
shawn dackonish : very few advertisements to deal with. a variety of simple vehicles to attain. the environments are different and fun to experience. simple mechanics,1
pussymaster mpampinos : the game is simple,1
shan n.s. : this is a very good game: controls are amazing,1
xavier lum : the graphic is appealing and fun to play. i hope the game has the option to allow me to revert my car's modification,1
katleho moroeng : please include an option where i can still have subtitles on my screen without the guy talking and please include new countries. other than that the game is perfect,1
fletch hasues : well produced game that is a good single player time passer. the screen controls are what make the game difficult. a large variety of vehicles to use that mimic automobiles of old.,1
kaarthik rm : cool game. but controls can be a toned down a lot. tries to bridge an endless runner and a car game to one. better control physics required. i only played a few minutes,0
spectre uv : it's a fun game and a great time killed but i think you should add more cars and have customization options instead of just changing the color... overall it's is a fun game.,1
fhs : great game. i know others have said they'd want a tutorial,1
jack gulledge : it's been good so far so i like it *edit* i've thought about the steering and i thought it would be cool to add the steering where the car turns with the device so i would love for the developers to think about this in a future update thank you and please take this into some major consideration,1
sabik. rahman : i don't know why other people gave it such good reviews,1
sabbir hossain : the overall graphics is good,1
adil khadir : good game,1
ken m : found your game on twitter on the first day of release! i love it! even though i actually never play any car/racing games at all. already unlocked all maps and all cars i wanted,1
anthony morabith : after the update with the controls tweaked and the breaks added,0
darsh thakkar : very good game. there's a lot of cars and i like the new multiplayer update and upgrade car feature . the new event car is very cool must try this game . i have been playing this game since 2019 .tip:- high grip cars are best for covering long distances . must try .,1
mihir gupta : right now there's a bug,1
scrubby puffer : i was not expecting this game to be so enjoyable. the graphics are quite appealing (neither too real and neither too basic). i enjoy that you can collect different vehicles and different maps. overall it's a good mobile game.,1
kye i love big batteryzzz : nice,1
tharvindh nair : it's a really great game. it gives the vintage gangster feeling. i would have given 5 stars but the controls is a bit messsed up. other than that the game is really awesome. hopefully to see some improvement in the next update,1
mr waseem malik : not recommended who are looking for entertainment here why device : realme android v 10 issues: 1. car is running in an auto speed and even if you break it stop or doesn't stop 2. sensitivity is failed you can't turn car left or right in an appropriate way 3. car is running out of control ..,0
muhamad muzzamil : this is game is super fun but super buggy. there was one time in which the audio and the gameplay doesn't sync as if the audio is in slow-motion. the special model switch part after maxing coolness doesn't show up.,0
champions gaming : best game but i would like if we could customise cars by adding bumpers ,1
will ratcliff : awesome! for a racing app,1
asher girton : best mobile game i've played in a long time. ads are also not bogging up anything. you're able to play with absolutely no ads bothering and you can choose to watch them to revive,0
hayato kaichou : i like the graphics and the controller is easy but the issue are can you add some great cars... i played these game in 3 months and i notice some of the cars are old school... just my opininon dont take it seriously... i really like to drift in racing games and this game is really what i wanted can you add mustang,1
maddox king : great game to pass time. it isn't overly complicated so you don't need to get engrossed into the game to do well. it feels very nice and fluent to play. it is very rewarding to get new cars and maps. highly recommend to people who like cars and car physics.,1
deepesh gupta : i really love the graphics. just polish the car a bit in the environment. because it's odd to see a plan player car in la mirabelle and other cars reflecting the yellow fog. i will give it 5 stars coz it diservers it.,1
mohammad amin hamednia : nice game... but keep working on it,1
sebastian r. stadler : so far it's amazingly fun to play! controls not like a real racing game but more arcade style but i love the graphics and the names for the cars. good game to pass some time.,1
pranab ranjanmandal : great game for time passing,1
jared barowitz : i get that the controls are a bit weird,0
iyinoluwa akinsuyi : absolutely love this game. it's the perfect game for me to pass time and still enjoy it. i love all the attentyto detail and most especially the photo mode... i'd definitely recommend it even if you're not a car person.,1
mrtimmsy1986 : it was fun for a few hours,1
aggressive driver : while this is good and enjoyable driving game,1
daniel folkins : ads don't play after every crash,0
summerizemlee noobest : a very fun driving game. awesome looking art style,1
han solo : everything feels so well polished,1
trey carpenter : coins/caps need to be worth much more. there are so many cars to unlock and they take forever to even get cheap ones. other than that it's a good looking time killer!,1
muhammad umar : the game is not working after this latest update. it shows the brake feature and says to double tap,0
corey ince : addictively fun. the graphics are cool and artistic. the learning curve is low making it easy to get into and the difficulty ramps at a decent pace. enjoy playing it so far.,1
leni _ : really enjoyable,1
anmol mishra : overall a good game to kill time. love the pixelated graphics and some retro vehicle options. one feedback to devs: please please introduce a reotro-wave themed map? the retro vehicle would pair aesthetically well with it.,1
denver albertyn : good but could use some improvements,1
jussi riissanen : great game,1
the rel h : i like the style and the mechanics really well made,1
cold campfire : a quality game by dovelopers who care it's fun with loads of 80s cars and good controls its also realy fun with the drifting but to be honest the brakes just don't work i almost never use them most of the time instead of saving you they will just make you crash but apart from that its amazing,0
michael jones : absolutely no innovation or new game mechanics from the typical constant drive game. super similar to highway rider basically the same thing except with almost minute long video ads every like 3rd play. game also has a stupid mechanic where it locks a directional,0
gregory barlow : insanely difficult to control. no check points that i could see to help you progress. i don't mind ads and i love driving games but this one blows,1
duran crisostomo mario : the video is wonderful,1
samuel : great graphics,1
christian james villanueva : car selection is worst,1
dio tube : its a little bit hard but fun,1
dillan brooks : only review i made for a mobile game. fun and engaging gameplay,1
anthony aiello : steering controls feel as if the amount you turn suddenly increases after half a second of holding the button. could use some tweaking,0
jacob oberg : fun,1
grau : it's a decent game,1
aaron foster : it's an endless runner (driver i guess) with a lot of variety in both levels and cars. quite easy to get into but also tricky to master as things start to speed up.,1
mariano sanchez : this is a really good game. the right amount of ads and lots of unlockables.,1
jasjeet gill : amazing cartoony graphics with great gameplay. but sadly it doesn't open after the new update and crashes frequently and haven't gotten a refund for my in app purchases so it's sad that i can't play and enjoy this great game.,1
zeorynex : the game is really fun and challenging in longer runs,1
the debonauzer : i'm playing on oneplus 7 and since the first add popped up,1
ike king : i had played it and was enjoying the game but after the last update,0
ryland novak : amazing. i absolutely love this game and the design concept behind it. the maps are fun to drive on and the cars all are pretty cool. its fun to see how far you can get and how many caps you can collect!,1
estevao andre : i loved everything in this game! its graphics and old times theme are amazing. the gameplay is very arcade,1
cai martin : i can be in the app for about 10 seconds before it crashes every time. looks fun and,1
romeo alpha yankee : nice graphics and great selection of cars and maps. but in a long run,1
fast turtle : i like this game ,1
tdog adkins : great game. i love to drive around endlesley,1
mayank kumar gupta : way too hard. you can't practically control the car. it just keeps madly swerving in and out of lanes. on top of it all,1
endersbane : honestly in my opinion it is the best arcade driving game in the store. it has fun gameplay and amazing pixel art for the car. i really hope the developers continue to improve and make their games.,1

benchi : love the game,1
louie tune : it's very easy to play and real graphics and very nice to see the full version download the free version and the best thing to work with a few words of wisdom teeth removed from work and effort to make a difference between what you were a lot to me with a white background and the other was a little while ago but it is not an intended,1

dune nyc : game won't even load. i see the name flash,1
mojito : good game. i dont like the new braking limit though. it also kept prompting me to rate the game which is why im here. i like that they added the unlock all cars and tracks which they didnt have with the previous version,0
jochay ben tovim : takes a lot to learn to drive. meanwhile i don't now if the scenery changes and devoleps the further you go because i can't ride for more than 5 min straight. besides the difficulty it's entertaining and has great vibe.,0

tower lachesism : a little grindy for unlocking new locations,1
donald davis : greying out the unpurchased vehicles was a bad move. drive is a different game. you dont have to grey out simply because others does it. it would be good if you reverts back. cos,1

mohit mohan mishra : i like the narration part,1
subin philip : while the game is good and graphics are kind of awesome,1
daniel myles : the controles are cool i love how the trackions under the tiers change what makes it interesting is how small the power up zones are (wonder if a pan cam would spice things up ...a nice zoom in and pan to the side on the car when passing another vehical or maybe a close shot when close to the walls but that would take some calculating for the sake of over all entertainment to be sustained with an alteration maybe another graphics enging with pan algorythems,1

samsu nihar : it is a very good game to play if you have not played any other games in android. or just a new one in big screen phone. may be the worst game on phone. the camera mode is a big deal to handle . also controls made this game more irritating . my request to the play store users please don't install . you will have to lost your mbs just.....,0
clixbrigidxterx : cons: i paid for it already but i still get ads. pros: great art style,0
vinay raikar : steering controls is tough - didn't work as expected. the beginner lessons could be better in terms of guiding users about controls. spent couple of minutes and got frustrated with the steering.,0
alex paez : opting out of their privacy stuff forces you to accept it when going back into the app. top 5 star review says ads are optional but that's total bs.,1
steve russell : the in-app purchase seems to revert with each update. i've paid for it twice now,1
nuansa kautsar : addicting game. it's similar to a lot of games. it's basically a running game. what i like about it is the visuals and graphics. not realistic,1

rens kwakkenbos : pretty good,1
"lapura the snep : this is a pretty fun game. when i just want something to do i can ""drive"" for a while and enjoy the art style. the challenges make it so you have something to do while you drive to keep it interesting. so try it maybe",1

troit : the game is good,1

akbar syahputra : interesting choice of games. this game is easy to learn but hard to master. various obstacles and challenge makes it interesting. the graphic was clasically awesome with great music,1
nomar zamora : i feel as there needs to be more maps and a little more cars to keep the game active also there is a glitch with the caps powerup where if you get the boost and die but watch an ad to be revived the caps boost keeps going for the rest of the game.,0
adidas slav : the cartoony graphics are very well designed,1
andrew jonathan : i love this game. but this game need 1 improvement. please let the player check the objective while playing. i mean let the player see the objective when the player click the pause button. that will make the player finish the objective faster.,1
amurillo reno : suggestion. could you guys possibly add daily missions/rewards? grinding the cap back then was okay since we didn't have to worry about upgrading our vehicle stats,1
mahan siamian : love your game... but need more things such as a zen mode with no traffic,1
kyle mcmillin : i think its better than drag racing and all the other car simulaion games but it would be better if the controlles was the same as the other games tho. its just arrows and u cant control the gas pedal only the break pedal,1

bendik herlofsen : looks good but i hate the toyota prius style of driving,1
ohmtrix : very nice game entertaining,1

baris atesli : awesome game. only would be better if you could unlock more cars with challenges. that would be awesome. other than that. maybe more challenges. awesome game!,1

joseph birdseye : good fun at first,1
trevon mckinley : amazing. really fun and cartoons. the physics are great. ot takes a little getting used to but it will just click. my new fav game. (classic muscle cars please) more free roam would be awesome too. i love you guys.,1
dunderhead 2000 : i like the graphics and the playstyle of it and i do appreciate a unique way of practicing. however i might appreciate it even more if there is a tutorial of how to drift or give me a heads up that there is a score multiplier if you drift :>,0

tito cruz : it's worth the 2.99 to get the add free version. did not disappoint.,1

ooga balooga : one of the prettier endless drivers out there. art direction is solid,1
satveer dhayal : i enjoyed a lot,1
wong jimmy : a very interesting game to pass the time. my only suggestion is that developer should make it easier for players to choose their vehicle of choice in this game. something like filtering search would be sufficient,1
vito melodia : overall this game is ok. just ok. funny enough but not to keep you entertained for a long time. art stile and soundtrack are good. progression is slow,0
some buddy : wicked fun game with a cute art style that screams fun. this game is what you would expect car driving with little realism to be. this game gives you a new kind of fun. the game is simple but becomes a challenge,1
leena bindra : game is nice. amazing concept. just add breaking system to the cars. some time some situations occur when i want to slow down car but there is no brake in it.,0
fadli kurniawan : minus the vision,1
bill whitlock : i love this game! it's not an easy game,1
sanchit vaidya : such a nice game with poly style graphic with no lags it's awesome and fun to drive lots of different cars and it's addictive but you can add more stuff like power ups which we get on road while driving and add contract like stealing car ,1

okay okay : very well optimized game. real time motion in background without any lagness. various types of vehicles to unlock and to upgrade them by collecting caps by playing the game. very nice animation .,0
sourabh kotwaliwale : fantastic gaming experience! the music makes it even better but on reaching the max level,1
wilfredo de leon : it's a good game and the graphics are stunningly good. i recommend adding more stuff for controls like steering wheel,1

max gorton : unplayable. as soon as i opened the game,1
jakov l ice l doric : it's about as good as can be,1

brandon flisram : very fun game. many different vehicles to choose from and challenges to complete. great game to kill time with. would love to see an 18 wheeler added!!,1
sumeet jena : the game is pretty cool and creative but sometimes has a lot of interruptions and gets stuck half of the time. it gets resolved temporarily only after restarting the app.,1
al marc : ok i have been playing this game now for 3 days. it is way too difficult to even be a game. just be prepared to crash every 10 seconds. leveling up don't mean anything. coins don't add up making buying new cars or even changing he color of the car impossible. honestly,0
d s : the gameplay is good graphics are also beautiful but controls are a bit hard. but overall this game is good. my suggestion is to make this a multiplayer racing game.,1
clever mind jr : awesome work. the graphics ,1
alex neil : neat little game. judging by the graphical style and infinite drive concept i was hoping it would have a nice synthwave soundtrack but it doesnt. this would be my advice for improvement,1
nick franco : it is amazing but i feel like there could be a little more diversity on the levels but besides that it is a great game and you just turn off your wifi or airplane mode so no ads,1
alexis ortega : i thought it was going to be a boring game... but i was clearly wrong! it's amazing with great graphics and i love the narrators voice and how he makes it feel like ur the one driving and he's on the passenger seat. ( ),1
gesse olausen : i played this a couple years ago,1

lucasperson : i have been playing this game for a long time,0
trust t. process : pretty dope. thought it'd be a little easier to drive but i may have to adjust the sensitivity. challenging but not too difficult. i'm assuming it's the driver doing the talking and he has a good sense of dry humor.,0
karl abraham : it's seems like an ok game. what took me out of it,1
dazed hxns : this game is top 3 of the best offline games this is just the perfect game it would be more fun if you can make 3 camera zoom selections like 1 is near 2 is standard and 3 is far person view so i can play music and act like it's a real road trip!,1
sebastian pettit : i absolutely loved this game before the update with the white boxes and all. i changed devices but was signed into google play before switching but now that im using my new device all my progress is gone except for my best distances for each location. please revert back to the old vehicle selection interface.,0

adam place : mechanics are fun,1
shubham singh : i like this endless runner with retro style and limit less vehicles to choose from. but what i didn't like was the level missions are repetitive and way too grindy.,0
abdulrahman alsaleh : i wasn't expecting that much fun from a game like this but i think i was wrong its good fun well made game easily can be one of the best games in the store 5/5 there only something is i dont see the different when i upgrade the vehicle or when i changed it like they all the same with a small change,1
jarred japtha : this game is awesome when you online and playing it lags but is quite simple also for an update the developers could add an endless mode so that you can drive through all the countries and you could earn some good money.,0
ib aj ya : good game,1

lostwispz12 : its pretty fun,1
ehtesham feroze : i rated it 4 stars cos when resetting everything there is a glitch which keeps the achievements please fix it but if it is a feature then add the option to reset those as well once you fix/add this i will rate it 5 stars.,0
pushp parag : not free to play. after a few races,0
matthew wiese : enjoyable content with a variety of cars to choose from,1
wan jaapar : good graphic and retro. but the steering control seems a bit challenging to me. maybe i need to upgrade the car so it wont drifting while connering.,1
mike hjorleifson : every time the cops chase it freezes for a second and then i'm in the wall. not really fun at that point. fix this issue and you'll get 4 stars. otherwise it's pointless to even play atm. getting pissed off....about to uninstall.,1
shirwatel simini : i can see some real potential for this game !!! cool graphics,1
anthony bechara : i was really surprised with this game,1
