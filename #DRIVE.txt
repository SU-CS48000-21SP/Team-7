victor visser : games great, literally worth the 5 stars. all i can really ask for is that you could customize your car the way you want to, like add a variety of different modifications, that would be really nice, also maybe a multiplayer mode where you can just simply roam the streets with your friends. that would be nice, overall a great game and i haven't been experiencing any problems at all. :))
atish ghosh : a great game! needs a bit of getting used to, to master it's controls. but once that's done - it becomes great fun. can't wait for more vehicles and maps in further updates.. if there is any criticism i had to add, it would be that the voice acting could've gone an extra mile indicating the incoming fuel pumps and other services. but that's a very minor issue. overall, it's a gem.
iulian toma : awesome! the only bug that i experienced is that, sometimes when you throw a doughnut it doesn't appear on the screen. :-) the main reason that i love this game is that you get an ad when you enter the game and that's it! :-d:-d (okay you can press a button to revive for free by watching an ad) i also like that you can revive only once. i have friends that play other runner games and revive continuously by watching ads. the perfect game!!! way to go, devs!!!:-):-):-)
nicholas wachon : this isn't just a phone game. this is a work of art. an amazing style that translates to both its location and vehicle design. gameplay is solid with nice nuances to master. one thing i would recommend for players to do is to turn off the ingame music and play music from your phone while in the game. that really adds to the roadtrip asthetic that the game conveys super well already. highly recommend.
mitchell davies : definitely worth downloading, lots of cars and the sensitivity control option for the steering does help. bought the most expensive car and after upgrading it to the max it drove worse than the small cheaper cars, i think the driveability is sometimes out when comparing how an expensive car and a cheap car handle the game. had this game for years and i still enjoy it , and no adds is very cheap
carl linden : fantastic variety of classic cars! and not just the fast ones! my favorites are the trabant and 126p. names of the all the vehicles are very well thought through as well. if i had a complaint it's the music and perhaps the floaty camera that makes me a little nauseous
corban woods : the game does everything it says it does and much more. every feature of the game is well thought out on how it interacts with the other aspects of the game making it a fun and casual game. you can play it casually whilst still being able to compete against others. one of the best free driving games on the play store
nuraeni : best driving game, at least in my opinion. the graphics are very good for low spec devices and the gameplay was a bit painful, but fun. even though some of the costumnization of "coolness" feature are nonsense, i still had some fun playing it.
djr99 : i love this game, love the cars, love the stage. but i found some thing that annoys me. so i bought the japan stage, i drove a lot there, but why the game wont record my drive? it keep the record on 0, the other maps are fine tho. please respond this, it might be a bug but idk
alx propka : nice, something differant. simple n complex enough.lots of cars to choose from and update.fairly easily by simply playing game, tilt stering with sensitivity adjustment would b a great option. . other than that game is low enough on storage (under300mb) but feel huge when playing =) i will keep it around in hopes of future updates id like to c .only time will tell, till then play store will let me know if i miss any updates. fun game i enjoy it. a must try for anyone.offline also.
sean marvin mendoza : the game is very good, in terms of graphics and selections in game, and i'm happy, that even though i'm bored, this is always my pastime, even without internet! and playing some 80s music while playing this game is sooo aesthetic!! the zen mode is also my favourite mode!! it's sooo beautiful and i hope that, you still add more of cars and settings like in miami, some parts in europe, east asia and southeast asia!! i always enjoy it!!!! thank you!!!
jesse bek : this is a very good quality game and i definitely recommend this. there is adds however and they do get annoying sontimes, but they are sort of rare. the controls are easy and the overall game i simple to master. there are really cool scenery places that are really good quality for most games.
nguyen huy : the game is beautifully designed in almost every ways, control is a little hard to get the hang of but it gives a little challenge which is always welcome. one downpoint is the selection screen navigation but overall an awesome game
matt : this is game has unique and stunning visuals and amaing gameplay, it feels like you're on a road trip! if i wanted to improve any part of the game i would only add more customization options, and maybe more modern cars? like around the 90's area. and maybe add a pc version? please add a pc version i beg of you
mayank mehta : great artstyle which is equally complimented by great maps and chill music. the game is great for playing casually while listening to podcasts n stuff. also includes a wide array of cars to play with including cop cars, easter egg unlockables and of course the special vans which are amazing.
sunteeth the genderpunk : its good. nothing too groundbreaking but worthwhile. doesnt pester you with microtransactions, you can slend maybe $15 buying one of their packs and then never pay another cent. no ads that ive seen. its not complicated and it doesnt need to be.
saker alabas : love the game, but have a few suggestions. first off, i never use the brakes, because they don't have much use. i feel like they should become an upgradable stat for each car, and more powerful, and braking shouldn't remove the ability to steer. also, the maps aren't balanced. holzberg is by far the best for collecting bottle caps, which leads to it being played more than others, tofuyama is incredibly difficult, vinh vang way easier than the others. the maps should be balanced a little better.
jordan araujo : not your normal endless runner, this game has "real" driving controls, as in, the cars don't just snap into the lanes at the press of the button. very fun experience, it's one of the only mobile games i'm thinking really hard about just buying it to remove the ads (game does not have intrusive ads cluttering the screen. they appear at the end of each run sometimes.)
tristan gamez : really good game ! a lot of cars from the 70s and that's change with other games who only have 90s jdm cars. the graphics are original and looks good. the maps number is ok and the control are easily to pickup. there's still things that can be improve or add, such as : more modification for the cars, a completely selectable colors, why not a switzerland map ? with a lot of mountains and village + beautiful roads it could be interesting and add cars like a monteverdi or opel gt 1900. tkx dev !
franjo vranjkic : #drive is one of the best games in it's genre. my favorite part is the business model: pay once, play forever, it does contain iaps but you earn plenty of money by playing and most cars are already unlocked. the graphics are really nice for a smartphone game. the soundtrack is also nice but could use a bit more variety. the gameplay = shut up and drive, you choose how difficult the game is by the car you drive and the upgrades you have installed. a must have for anybody who loves driving.
aysha khanam : this game is absolutely awesome. i think i got blessed. i don't have word now.how amazing and cinematic game is this!!but it would be more epic if you give a update. and the update will be a mode where it is only mode for crash. i mean like zen mode pro cam mode beside these there will be crash mode it will only crash and make the road block)!
clint s. : (slava ukraini) (and poland, for their part by helping the refugees!) update: thank you for making the ukrainian map less gloomy! #drive is a really fun, casual game. the right amounts of: easy-enough that losing isn't frustrating, and difficult-enough to make you want to keep playing. one of the few games that i've kept updated over the last couple years! which for that matter, it continuously has new cars being added, seems like one almost every week, which is awesome.
yevhen revko : awesome experience that resonates with the late '70s - mid '80s movies like the original gone in 60 seconds and early driver games. nice handling for an arcade game and awesome low-poly visuals, definitely a game worth trying. special kudos to the developers for also giving credit to the '80s japanese car scene and adding a car that attempts replicating the r30 skyline!
cyan tasks : one of the very few games nowadays that don't focus on milking your wallet until its dry. nice attention to detail with the different types of food for differemt maps, the one thing is, is there a way to sort the cars by number order?
jason burleigh : really enjoyable and addicting little game! been playing a short time and already seem to have worked through most everything with the exception of car unlocks, so i'd love to see a lot more content in the way of tracks and challenges, awards/incentives etc. would also be cool to have finer control of customizations (colors, maybe rims or window tint and the like). that being said there's plenty here for most anyone, and the devs seem to add smth new with almost every update. great work! :)
non metallic : this game is a masterpiece. i have no problems with this game. amazing soundtracks, cars, coolness, colours, it's just...........programmed by lord.
ara kazarian : amazing! please guys, fix the steering buttons in different gameing modes: steering buttons don't normally respond when i click on them, only the default steering mode works properly.
v t chacko vilayappillil : really enjoying ur game ,i really like it. i really appreciate if u add defferent camera modes on gameplay. if u don't mind camera modes on gameplay 100/ download it !!!!!
eric lamoureux : cool little game & nice, frequent updates. awesome selection of cars! also you can play with a controller. by the way it would be cool if you released this on consoles and pc. thanks
sir abhishek : i don't usually right reviews on play store but man is this game so good i had to right a review. the graphics are cartoony but in a good way...the sound tracks for each map are bangers. no unnecessary inapp purchase needed to progress. i have played lot of games both android and pc and this is in my opinion one the bests hands down
cosyhamster : now there is gamepad (controller) support because of the nintendo switch release. honestly, this game is better than minecraft bedrock edition (java is cool but pc only) at this point. not because the game is free, but because it's not annoying and i enjoy playing. my phone really pretty budget and pretty slow (2gb ram), yet this game runs super well. best mobile game on google play. also, google play games backup is epic! got bored, reinstalled, game data still there.
k.h -es 300 : i think it is realy fun to play, but if you could add the skyline r32(my dream car), then i would be super happy, and would gladly give a five star reveiw! (a year later) you know what, the r30 is awesome dangit.( another year later) i have to say thank you for all the work that's been put into this. i mean an older, cheaper skyline i can acctualy afford? that... it's like... i mean it's car heaven! heaven i tell you! this game is awesome!
sulma humes : i like this game its good the graphics are awesome too keep up the good work!just a thought maybe u should add manual acceleration and the steering wheel it would really change the game so can u pls do that? thanks
colten potts : really entertaining. it is very challenging and high quality. the variety of vehicles and maps lead to endless fun
ken esaga : i recommend adding sports cars and aesthetic cars to make the game more interesting, add some new maps too to add more excitement.
travis puariea : very very very very awesome game. 20/10. the art style, the gameplay the crontrols are all unique in there own way.
amy bricknell : this is the best game i have ever played!!!!!it is amazing. i love the cars do you know that i have the monstertruck i love the tracks aswell. and its cool how you set it out. and it doesn't come of the phone!!!yaaaaaaaaay. so you get the point i like the game it is the best
donathan : a fun little game with a cool aesthetic, great car selection and lots of personality. you don't need to pay to enjoy the full experience, making #drive a golden needle in a haystack of pay-to-win cashgrabs.
sadness : awesome! even though its just a endless subwaysurfer type game with cars it feels different. im not a fan of top down cam but this ones cam angle is fun can u guys another camera mode pls?like a lil bit more closer to the car then it would be sooo fun to drift.
metalman690 : great little time waster that doesn't require internet connection. easy to pick up, frustratingly annoying to master.
take flight : fun game, simple and enjoyable. perfect to play while waiting for something. and there aren't too many ads either.
truckrobo147 : its really fun and it feels like the road would never end and it also has wonderful collection of cars and get them with bottle caps is a fun idea!
bokibashub : this game is very cool and a bit realistic.then you break, it will show an sign of burning car discs. that's how you make a cool game
christopher rossler : cool game. name of the cars are super funny and always nod to some pop culture. hint to the devs. in german it's "der wagen" not "das wagen".
kaylen abuaqel : this is the best car game i have seen yet ngl. it is so easy to get money(caps) in this game and get new games. i would tell everbody to play this game emedently.
jack fagan : not a normal mobile game it's not a pay to play and adds are optional there is plenty to do and the art style is cool the devs add new content such as new cars and places to go evey so often. the game is basically you driving forward for as long as you can while collecting money and doing side quest and avoiding the cops every so often. the graphics are great and there is even a picture mode. the cars are all cool some even coming with special abilities such as cops won't chase you. good game.
andrey baste : i really like this game. attention to details is what buys me. music on the background, photo mode, well balanced management, nice controls, car selector is unusual, locations and phrases that main hero drops make the game satisfying.
a.k. rebel : fantastic balance of appropriate humor, reliability, and fluid gameplay. controls take some time to adapt to but needless to say drive scores the bullseye for unique sensation perfectly. scour the whole play store and you'll never find an endless driving game as diverse nor as thrilling as this one. highly recommend.
vivek jayan : fun game. love the art style and the care/attention to detail. car mechanics could've been a bit tighter. they feel a bit boat-like. but i guess that's the challenge. keep it up guys. your team's passion is very evident.
henry pettigrew : try as i might, i can't find anything wrong with this game. it's mechanics are awesome, the places are awesome, the cars are well made and cool-looking, and the simple controls just make for an amazing game!
carson williams : great game, constant updates, keeps you interested, verity of cars only thing that i would say is that more maps should come in or limited time events like the christmas one. other wise this one of my favorite games.
drasila rowaro : i love the graphics and the car but it's hard to play but i love it thank you so much, this game change my life.
jay kozatt : love it to bits! the game loop is addictive, and it fulfills your fantasy of being like takumi from initial d.
tempo slapzy : it's a really good game it keeps me entertained and i like that it gets more challenging as difficult without even noticing till you almost crash lol
leonard rey chua : this game is a time killer and gameplay is beautiful may i suggest can you add more places like tokyo, new york city, los angeles, italian sea side town, and etc. just to make the game more exciting.
wilczur : a really nice game with a lot of "classic" cars from many different countries and the game is still getting more stuff which is very nice, steering is kinda weird but it's easy to get used to
tyler burns : i love how even though they updated the game it still has the same classic music, and the same classic control, can't wait to unlock a lot of the new cars and try all the new maps they added! keep up the good work!
robert rarrick : it takes some getting used to but the game overall it seems like a good game to play when i'm waiting for something and like waiting for my meal at mcdonald's type stuff
amirul daniel : this game are awesome but why i can't play at tofuyama because i stuck at loading screen ....can you fix this for all player .... i hope you can fix this problem
ostan5000 : this game has a lot of creativity put behind it. you can definitely tell that the people who made it have a great taste in cars!
matvey lopalo : best way to describe this game is, the car version of subway surfers. i love it
silas coelho : super fun, prices for the cars could be a bit better, though!
amigo junior : it a very nice game. helps you to drive but my problem is that the controls are too fast.
zain ranjha : good game, decent graphics, tons of cars, various maps and regular updates plus no ads or pay 2 win.. honestly one of the best and very few indie games you can get for free on play store.. kudos to developers who made this game well balanced in every aspect and also work hard to give out regular updates. and i know the devs. take the comments of players into consideration, i would suggest that more power ups like invincibility, nitro boost, car size increase and auto drive should be added.tia :)
luka goshadze : love the physics. drifting feels nice. lovely artstyle. few adds. not pay to win. would be nice to add more wide corners for drifting on long distance and to increase drinfting bonus, couse it stops at 5x.
lowo : zen mode, variety of maps, tons of cars, music... everything is good..
danilo okovic : it's a great game overall, nice visuals, many cars, a few (but great) maps, and enough stuff in the game play to keep you focused but at the same time enjoying a relaxing drive
wayne corbitt : i love the new cars that keep gitting added to the pc version but do you think you could update the switch but still love the game
ty sells : i like it. socks it didn't restore all my progress when i switched phones but it's still fun!
f4rish 1304 : best.easy controls and realistic.in next update could you customized car.
tony gagliano : coolest game ever but you should really put some more car phisics like if i hit the wall with my car the bumper will fall of
huludet flavius a. : i like this game, looks perfect for me with these graphics.
alberto giavani : used to play this a lot on my old phone, overall great game, like, download it now if you're bored.
markos200 java : this game is really great there are so many things to do in this game ti hasn't any ads
albert calderon : i think it's a very interesting game and it keeps me motivated and happy to play more thank.
sheldon macquinto : very good game, i like how the cars closely resemble real life ones
nolawi engida : the best game ever but add a little more action overall love it . keep it up
john smith : been playing for 30 minutes, already addicted. graphics and fps are really good, could add multiplayer and a drag racing mode. other than that great game, might join the discord server as well
jayanth challa : the most lovable driving game. thank you for showing ukraine and show all other countries too.
jesus cardona : the cleanest game ever but it could be a bit more interesting with a few things added like ramps
gerard patrice : very interesting game and take on racing/driving. i see the game is also on switch that's awesome
keith montgomery : i love this app because there are so many different types of vehicles to win. the game is easy to play with excellent graphics and lots of fine detail in the scenery. well done to the app devlopers.
constantina v. : finally, i found a game to play while listening to my 200 song eurobeat playlist. it's actually pretty fun and ads are not invasive or commonplace. i also like the artstyle a lot, graphics are pleasing to the eye and not too demanding on low-end phones. i just wish there was an option to silence narrator/co-driver without having silencing all the sound effects. don't get me wrong, i love the cheesy dialogue (monologue, really...), but that option would be nice.
pixality dev : i remember seeing posta about this game on an indie dev facebook group. i couldn't wait to play it! now that i've had a chance to download and try it. i love it! it's lots of fun and the controls are great! sure they're hard for people nt used to the touch controls. but they're good, using breaks is really important. gives me memories of micro machine games. the visuals are great and performance is great. the dialogue lines are great too!
moaz malik : good game, fun progression. plenty of cars and interesting locations. most of the tracks are well designed but the one set in france is horrible. music is mostly good. the car upgrade feature is a miss. why would anyone want to upgrade speed or acceleration in a game where the whole point is to avoid obstacles and traffic? pro tip: go for the cars with the highest grip to speed ratio.
mr. barrel : okay, so: 1. the controls aren't bad, you're just bad at the game. 2. braking is not double tapping, it's holding both sides of the screen. 3. holding one side then the other will initiate a wide turn which increases a score multiplier. the direction of this turn is directed by the first touch. 4. this game has no end goal, it's another "endless" game and, for once, a high quality one. don't look for a meaning to this game if your life doesn't have one.
charles sieburg : amazing there are only a couple of very small things i would change. 1: i wish there was a way to completely downgrade grip. drifting is what makes this game amazing. 2: it wouldn't be that hard to a a "city" freeroam version where you can left or right as well as forward. they could totally charge for it, and i would pay. overall, amazing job!
ryan greythorn : the game itself is paying a great homage to your childhood top-down racing game, except it wasn't really a racing because you were only overtaking the traffic. #drive is as simple as that. no time pressure but also no brakes. keep on driving till you hit something. these lovingly modeled cars are all icons of the days that will never return, and it certainly adds to the outrun mood the game has. the controls are right on spot as well. if you love the 80s and driving, this is for you.
o j : this game is great and has few ads. the steering seems finicky at first, but, once you learn how to drift, everything makes sense. there are no licensed vehicles, but the ones in the game are heavily inspired by legendary cars, which makes collecting them a joy. my only issue is that drifting could be explained in the tutorial a little better, which would help make the game more welcoming for new players, but this game is still stylish and insanely fun. i can't wait for more content to be added!
daniel : good casual driving fun. the visuals are stylised but not too cartoonish; the car handling is simple and arcadey but not so that there's no difference between all the cars; there's a nice selection of different cars and environments. all i hope for in future updates is more environments and i'd like some different passenger voices; not that i dislike the current one, just for variety, at least a female option would be good. highly recommended as is though.
ben crockford : this is one of my favourite games of all time. the graphics are amazing, and the gameplay is great. one thing to ask is that do the cars have different abilities not just that they look different. i think what your game could improve on is like minigames. for example, see how many cars you can smash in a certain amount of time. thanks!
brennan lyle : this is a pretty fun infinite-driving type of game where you have to dodge traffic, collect powerups, and everything else you'd expect. the in-game coin costs seem pretty fair, so that with a bit of time spent you can unlock the vehicles you want without having to worry about an in-app purchase. really, the only in-app purchase that you should want is removing ads, because otherwise it can get somewhat annoying.
chinmay ghule : what a gorgeous game! i have nothing to say. this game is just pleasing to the eyes. if i really want to find a fault, it would be: (1) there is no option for setting up the music volumein the game, as i don't like to keep changing my phone's volume for each app/game. (2) there should be a radio option with some default songs who will be randomly played while you're driving. even better would be to play your spotify playlist if possible. (3) option to customise your appearance on license.
rubied snoot : gotta say, it's pretty rare i reveiw an app, but this one has stuck around from phone to phone and continues to evolve for the better! went and bought the ad removal for it, it was worth it just considering the price of a small game like this! gameplay is straightforward, but still challenging, and you'll rarely be without little challenges to complete or a new vehicle or zone you want to unlock! give it a go, it's a great way to burn some time and rubber!
ian palmer : great endless runner, the resources run out quickly though so long runs can be difficult and require more attention than some others. there is a large selection of cars to unlock but are a direct investment of time played. as much as i love this game i'm even more glad it isnt in the pay to win category (or even worse, "free to start"). thank you for designing a game where the only payment that will improve my experience is the option to remove ads.
ferraro's garage : this game is awesome, i love playing. however more things could be added like an italian map, and an english map. also a color wheel for car paint would be cool too. another addition to the game could be an online like police chase or racing, those would really fun to have in the game that would really improve it. overall though it's a fantastic game.
jesse stewart : this is easily the best "endless running" game (endless driving in this case) that i've played. each new car is fun and not too difficult to unlock. they all have great steering mechanics. and the customization of your vehicles is a neat feature. the graphics are also spot on for the type of game they're going for. 6 stars out of 5.
joe maina : 10/10. graphics are and physics are great and there are so much things to explore and maps. i recommend downloading this game. and there are many different types of cars. the bad thing is you need to grind alot. please add more modifications.and its not a pay to win game.the voice acting is great i love how they put so much effort into this game.
bruno volonteri : this is, without a doubt, one of the best games currently on the play store. a fun, simple, arcadey gameplay and the most beautiful artstyle ever. every map has its own distinct style both in graphics and gameplay, and the selection of cars to unlock, each one unique and iconic, is enormous and grows on every update. truly a pleasure to play. i would only add more objectives after level 20, after which the game feels a bit more focused on unlocking everything and gets a little bit grindy. 11/10.
aron : challenging and rewarding. i really like this game! the progression is pretty grindey, but not aggressively so, and the gameplay in itself is relatively simple. though you still have to earn new cars, and do so through skill that you actually build up. and you can play it casually too, if you aren't willing to spend too much of your time on it. solid 5 stars!
killerrabbitx : i've changed my mind about this game, it's pretty great. kills time well, the ads aren't overbearing, good controls. my favorite thing about it is how polished the graphics are. i only have suggestions instead of complaints: one: i wish the driver wouldn't nag you about gas if you have more than 3/4 of a tank when passing a station. two: more maps, please.
amanda duncan : this game is a very fun infinite runner that you can pick up and play anytime, i love the look of the game and how it shows that a lot of care went into designing the locations and cars. the only problem i've had is that when i go into photo mode it shows a dark grey screen instead of my car and its surroundings, if you can fix that problem that would be very nice and i would be wishing that i could give games 6/5 stars!
aniket debnath : i freaking love the game man. it's genuinely one of the games i've kept downloaded longest on my phone. i love the maps, the music, and the subtle differences in handling of the cars. don't like the loss of traction on the mars map tho. also, suggestion for you guys. why not tailor maps specific to each vehicle type that's been created? like offroad maps for off road cars and the rally cars, racetrack like maps for speed based vehicles and so on. 10/10, great way to kill a little time.
ollie thomas : really good concept! once you start to get a feel for the controls it's really nice to play, not to mention you don't get bombarded by ads and you can still play off line, i really think there's a future for this game, it can be turned into a track game, time trail or maybe even a drift game, i'd like to see how this game progresses
shashank seth : excellent graphics. talking about the controls, i like the minimal controls, just the two buttons, once you're used to it and starts paying attention to signs, it becomes more fun! the garage can be better, the cars for higher price has very low specs as compared to the default one. moreover, dev can add some car upgrades, smooth scrolling, some visual mods in garage! also a live in-game coin counter is missing. overall it's an amazing experience. keep it up dev! best minimal racing game till now
eric e franco m : this game is sweet! it checks all the boxes. the #visuals are beautiful, very well designed and animated; the cars, the locations, the background. #sounds are also high quality, narration voice is smooth, and music changes accordingly. #gameplay is easy at first, but actually requires some skill, may be a bit hard later. cool cars with cool names that reference the originals. every update actually adds to the game and improves the overall experience. it's not perfect, but gets close. love it!!
luke_425 : fun, simple controls, great game overall. plenty of maps to drive on, and they're all endless, so you go for as long as you can, picking up gas and repair kits along the way, as well as fending police off with doughnuts, which is quite a fun concept. loads of different cars to unlock, so there's a lot of progression, and ads are surprisingly rare in all honesty. definitely recommend.
neil caezar : amazing game, a bit hard to control the car and stay on the road but its kinda rewarding when you get the hang of it, graphics are great, the humour and challenges in this game makes you wanna play this foreverrrr. only problem i have is i got all the tracks, and now have alot of postcards which i have no use anymore, maybe we can convert it to caps or special cars. other then that, i'd recommend this game to everybody with a brain.
connor watkins : 5 star game for sure. the graphics are really nice and have a great polygonal style to them. it runs offline, so when you're in a waiting room (or wherever you may just want to throw your focus at something else) you can play regardless of your internet connection. the only thing i could fault this game for is maybe the controls. they feel kinda janky every now and then, but once you play for around 10 minutes then they kinda become muscle memory ig.
mohamed hussein : best f***ing game on the store! absolute beauty! not only the driving is great, and the graphics are cool, and the mood is so immersive. it's constantly updated with new content every single week! for a guy who likes cars, driving games, and the 70s this game is the game. can't stress enough on constant content updates! magnificent quality on every level.
ditiro shayi : kudos, the scale and proportion of both the cars and the environments. the physics are top with the cars reacting to the different surfaces and how the wheels adjust to degree of turn. the controls have hit a sweetspot, the cars can respond to little adjustment turns to full on swerving. the balance of the controls can lead to some daredevil maneuvers that are constantly satisfying and commentary is also welcomed. the mountain passes of japan can be a great location... if you catch my drift.
goran ratkovic : such a great game, honestly! the graphics are awesome, looks like everything has been put well together and every tiny detail has been thought throughly. the option to select such a wide variety of cars (both european, us, japanese, each and every one you could think of), a large number of tracks to drive, it really is one of my favourite games so far. the controls, however they might feel flimsy, they're k to work with. and the option to select a controller is even better. i'm still about to give it a try on my android box, can't wait to try it!
hiraya : great game but... maybe you could add some more features like missions, and having some prizes when the mission is completed like cash or exclusive cars, and also having upgrades for cars is kinda exciting. also it is hard to control but when i played it for 2 days i finally understand the concept and how to control the car effectively. but, having an advanced settings or control settings might be helpful to some, to make them comfortable to play it and also i am looking forward for the new map.
dudemanbro 2006 : this game is amazing! its very fun and super addictive. the controls are easy to get used to and you can choose from 3 different control options. the tracks are all very neat to look at as well. there are also so many cars. and they are all awsome! the only thing is that mayby you can add music more like chase music. like from smokey and the bandit and movies like that. that would be amazing. but overall a superb game!
tom : great game super chill wide range of cars and almost no ads
use : whaff app : get iok doiiars : i have never lost a drive by missing fuel station. almost always that's because of hitting an other car. the police is also not any threat. on the other hand, just a small hitting an other car results in losing a drive. the overall game mechanics should be better balanced and should be more real. the app has also some bugs on going to the background and being killed by the memory manager on android 10. the app doesn't always save the last used car, which is annoying.
david moore : fun game. small amount of ads (i mean that in a good way.) and thats all i really have to say about it
user anonymus : this is an incredible game, simple, self-sufficient and very tightly-designed. every part of it feels thoughtfully deliberate: adorably simplistic yet pretty graphics, an overabundance of available cars, variety in locations, satisfying drifting mechanics, a pleasant yet not overwhelming amount of powerups, etc. no aspect of #drive is excessive, everything here is in it's place. premium features are non-intrusive, which is definitely a notable plus. i enjoy it greatly.
saurav allen : very well rounded endless runner! though the physics are a bit jarring but they are the defining characteristics of the game's dna and are easy to get used too. the scenery is eventful and the ui and other design elements are elegant. the cars and music are from the 90s and the game is theme based. definitely a good pastime. the progression rate is just right too!
abhishek sharma : this game feels so good and cool at the same time. the music catches your brain . have to say it's lit.
om ji maurya : gameplay is incredible whether it's regular or zen mode.graphics is beautiful and selection of cars is also good. controls are good enough but choice of control are somewhat lacking. overall it's really a great game and probably best endless racing game. you can feel that developer has really a good taste and artistic sense. a few improvement are needed in controls to make drifting a bit easier and add options for different camera angles. more control options and customised touch controls .
samuel graczyk : very responsive, addictive, and looks great (pls make the grey bars at the top n' bottom of the screen more dark tho) the damage model is a bit strange tho when you hit things, like you can slam the tail into a wall and it hardly does anything, but if you graze the front end off a car or fence it does a stupid amount of damage or takes you out completely, this is the real problem i found with the game, apart from that, really fun game would recommend to anyone, looking forward to future updates
tom robinson : most driving games on android try to copy games from consoles and computers far more suited to the style than phones or tablets will ever be. drive does things differently and knowing the limitations of mobile gaming has made a thoroughly enjoyable game! i know some have complained about ads in the free version, and i agree that they're a bit intrusive, but the paid version is so cheap that if you enjoy the gameplay, it is absolutely worth buying
vince : i'm giving this 5 stars because i think it deserves over 100 million downloads, but something minor that i would like to see tweaked just a bit is the turning. it's extremely difficult to make your car go straight again after a complete turn. maybe you need to add auto straightening to make it less frustrating for the casual audience.
tactical baguette : i wasn't expecting much from this game but it's surprising how fun it is. it's similar to other endless runner games but with more freedom than swiping between 3 lanes. the car selection is very large with plenty of cars from the 70's and 80's, and you can buy them in any order which makes unlocking them far more enjoyable. getting caps to buy cars and upgrades is very fair and you won't spend too long earning them for the cars you like. try this game out if you want a nice little time killer.
dutch brother : great little game. tons of progression. friendly discord server. not all that many adds
caleb a. : amazing game. love the controller support.
arlon waggoner : im loving this game there are so many cool cars alot of maps and diversity and i like the coolness button overall good game
kieran morgan : enjoyable game, love the art style and the controls are difficult to adjust to but after a while of playing you do get used to them. however, for me the pro camera is quite difficult. i don't like that a simple tap into a car immediately destroys you and you have to start over again, however you just have to get used to the controls and be able to avoid the cars. i feel like the reward system is fair and you get a fair amount of coins from playing.
ivan urban : great graphics, very nice retro vibe in the menus, car selection, tracks, 70'-80's vibe . easy addictive gameplay and not to much annoying ads
cosmic : game plays fantastic! once you get used to the controls and find your favourite car theres no stopping you. in the length of time i've played maybe an hour or two i've already unlocked another track and bought 3 of my favourite cars. i feel the mechanics and reward system are well balanced so far and with some minor tweaking will be perfect. collision detection seems fair and is defendant on what size vehicle you drive. the visuals, audio and voice overs are a+ looking forward to playing more
joao berlindo : i haven't played for a very long while but from what i've seen this is a very fun game for those looking to just drive off into the sunset but still needing to dodge a few things on their way, the graphics really the phone in my opinion, the vehicles available are also not only nice but creative in the name that has been given to them and the controls are pretty straight forwards when you get used to what you can do. i haven't played many of the maps yet but i believe their equally nice.
how2code group ltd. : wow! this game is all you will ever need. amazing graphics, physics and a bunch of cars, although my car formula is [n + 1] so there can always be more, i don't really have anything much to say about the game since it's amazing, just maybe the devs should add more maps, and maybe when your doing quests and click for more info it should be better explained quest, but other than that nothing really. the game is repetative, but for some odd reason it's also a source of endlsss fun! great job devs!!
unfoundable : its a great game good amount of cars the driving is kinda hard but it gets easy when you get used to it
jonatan edrik tanoto : great graphics, great gameplay. if you play this game for the first time. the car will be hard to handle. but with enough practice. the car will become controllabe and you can enjoy the beauty of the game. the developer is underrated. really need some appreciation. so i bought the "unlock all cars and tracks" option and it's not that expensive. a huge thumbs up for the developer. and this game get very constant updates which prevent boredom. really great experience so far!
alessandro thome : this game is one of the best mobile games i have ever seen. amazing controls, tons of content, consistent updates; i mean, what more could you ask for? truly stunning graphics, and super optimized. you could run this on a samsung galaxy s1! i'm really at a loss for words. the endless gameplay is seamless, and it's already got me addicted! (there's too much effort put in lmao) overall, it's just an amazing game, and i'd like to see the games this developer puts out in the future!
dkkl dicer : love it. art style is unique and the gameplay is pure fun. with a minimalist approach to the game, it incentivices the player to play the game, without too much complicated mechanics. at the same time there is a learning curve associated with it, making it more addictive to the casual players. and the quirky dialogues removes any monotony in the game. as a game developer in training, this game makes me feel hopeful for what i can expect and make in quality games in the future. keep it up.
nani 'bella' popper : the most laid-back test of wit & reflex i've experienced with a "true" arcade game yet. the simple, smooth & responsive controls are easy to jump into & fun to master, there's tonnes of unique cars that are all acquirable without cash, the infinitely rendering roads fluctuate situations from easy cruising to critical decision making, the levels are cozy and the soundtrack is great. awesome for just diving in and playing, no fuss no muss, and my favorite game to play when im super stoned. cheers!
grayson gillard : this game is one of the most beautiful, well done mobile games i've ever played. it's simplicity is astonishing, but it's graphics and gameplay are extremely fun and great for long road trips or waiting rooms. because this game needs no wi-fi it can be played anywhere. the only thing i would do to improve this game is a little backstory or increased complexity. seriously, download it!!
mateusz tegi : to be perfectly honest this is the best racing game i've ever played on mobile and maybe even beats some of the ones i played on my pc. the adds aren't bashful and only appear when the player wants to see them for some extra money. the graphics are really good and the game runs smoothly on my device. controls are simple but intuitive and responsive. i really have to say that i'm impressed and this game is one of my favorites on mobile. i congratulate the developers for doing such a good job.
liam lewis : such a good game, easy to get good, awesome amount of cars, upgrades are cheap and good only one request: an open world map (other than the training map) and i have a few ideas for it: main quests, which leads to a boss race (including mini bosses and win their car when beaten), side quests (get caps and post cards) and hidden cap stashes all over the map. so you decide if its a good idea.
el duderino : i absolutely love how player friendly this is, from gameplay to in-game currency, almost everything in the exists almost solely to serve the player, something very rare in video games let alone mobile games today. the cars and locations are great, gameplay is fantastic, controls are nice, the graphics (love the cinemascope) are stunning and my overall experience has been phenomenal. a few things to make this game better: -settings in pause menu -option to disable dialogues -more locations!
giorgi megrelidze : i spent 3 hours playing this game and its so good. its offline and it trully just drags you in.
zane barker : many cars and stuff to try just wish it was a little easier to make money that's about it.
ilias t : wow! what a game! absolutely brilliant game. the graphics are stunning, lots of cars to choose from, many unique locations too. ive seen some people complain about the steering - its not hard at all. only suggestion is if you could add a multiplayer mode with wifi. other than that, fantastic game.
leo nguyen : i love this cozy driving game! it's 10x better with a controller.
evan matthews : great game if anyone remembers driver for ps2 you will love this game the grafics and music are great
kickin it with dae dae & dre dre : i think he's doing this, like really good game, because the emotions and stuff like that is my first time to me, super great.
ruvik b.l. : an excellent game with fun gameplay and superb graphics and style
rajit pimpale : amazing game. lots of things they did new than other games, and this game has its own personality. just took a long time to get used to the controls, they're really hard for a new comer to pick up (kept losing in the tutorial itself). apart from that, all too cool.
oddlysilent : this is the best mobile game i have ever played. the high quality, infrequent ads and sheer amount of things to unlock, work toward and do is just amazing. the work put into this game is astonishing. the only bad thing i have to say about it is it has a kind of low skill ceiling. the infinitely generated terrain makes for a challenge, but you get pretty good pretty fast. overall, 10/10, would recommend.
kerr vfx : this game is what mobile developers should strive towards creating. the game runs smoothly and looks great, the visuals are quite charming and all the cars have their own personalities. i find myself getting quite attatched to the cars and tracks as i play. the controls are great, nothing feels overwhelming; just as a mobile game should be. advertisments in this game are not obnoxious. passion and talent from the dev team are blatantly observable in all aspects of this game.
yuri gor : it would be cool to add motorbikes. bikes are slim, so it's easier to play in some cases, but you cannot ignore most of minor obstacles, as you do using car. and maybe it's not so easy to add them, because you will need animate pilot body separately. but it would be super cool, because philosophy of bikes fit perfectly the vintage atmosphere of the game. maybe it a be subject of next game #ride
trey miller : one of the best endless driving games i've ever played. good controls.
havoc nine : this game is actually quite fun. it's satisfying to drift around corners and to dodge traffic at the same time. only complaint i have is, not being able turn the black bars on the bottom and the top off, either add that option or at least make it where we can adjust it to be bigger or smaller.
unused account do not reply : absolutely gorgeous little game. virtually everything works perfectly and it isn't ad heavy in the slightest. some additions i wish to suggest would be a couple of run down versions of cars that you get once you go through perhaps 100 junkyards and more detailed models when you enter picture mode. but to be clear, this game is already utterly brilliant, and these are mere suggestions.
mitali roy : gonna enjoying driving! i've seen no other driving game which is as awesome as this. beautiful classic cars, breathtaking locations and tricky roads are making me stick to the screen. also the car rewarding system is good! you get new vehicles in every new levels. keep up updates, and i will keep up driving! and maybe some donations for support. will be better if you add some currency rewards after each level up.
noah mifsud : this is a beautiful game with good gameplay and fun mechanics (the drifting is surprisingly cool and rewarding). each location has its own challenges and quirks making what could be a monotonous grind feel consistently engaging. i do wish the different surfaces (snow, wet roads, dirt) had more of an impact on the driving.
yogesh agarwal : this game exceeded my expectations. i mean not only there are several cars and maps but you can almost customise any car as well add some coolness to it. the only con i find is after putting game on pause we don't get a countdown for resuming it back which i think is a downfall. also you'll can add some challenges which can be pretty amazing as after finishing all the levels and achievements there's nothing left to do. you'll can even give some rewards for challenges. fabulous game!!!
chutneyperson : very polished experience, cars control realistically (for a phone game) and shift their weight around, it was a little hard to control until i cranked the sensitivity down to 0, otherwise it's too easy to overcorrect, my only complaint is that new cars tend to cost a lot compared to the amount earned in a good run and if they where cheaper i'd pick the game up more often to get a new car
khan ahnaf tahmid : incredeble graphics & cars, controls are simple, i love the 3d effect in car & map menus. highly recomended if you want challenges or just relax in zen mode
jack maguire : easy to get the hang of difficult to master
red reign : a great endless driving game and there are some cons but i don't have a complain the grapichs are good too good job
karamjit singh : the game was very nice ,very nice but cars was too expensive but one times buy that has more fun #drive
ferrial pondrafi : simple and fun. the low poly style is wonderful.
craig : fun for time pass, but needs some fixing like in the drift park, where if you ram the wall you cant get out
evan brannon : i love this game all the cars the maps and the fact they only have few ads
saud amir : this is an amazing game and i really like it but so sad little timmy couldn't play it
rajeshkumar langhnoda : one of the best car game. plese add new city(of india). nice game.
blackout 5x5 : i love the art style and the gameplay is super satisfying
kamsiyochukwu ejeckam : cool game love the cars the physics the graphics its amazing pls could u add a race mode
henry sus bro : very fun game love it. an hour passes and i didn't even notice
david oniceanu : very cool game!! i love the cars and the graphics!!!
coma falca : i really like the game i hope some day you will add visible car damage
justin daly : extremely fun, i could sit and play this for hours on end.
jorel williams : it is a very nice game zen mode need some work but very nice
spongy leo : a really fun game to play on your free time. i can't find anything wrong with this game.
bill clinton : pretty great game, i thought it was going to be similar to those games that just have a straight road and you have to survive as long as possible but its way different and theres more of a challenge then just surviving, you have to get refuel and make sure your car doesn't get damaged, the only time i get ads is to revive. its honestly a good game
alokym creeper : i have few tips. add number overlays over car stats. you will have best of both worlds - precision of numbers and visual size of "stacks". drifting mechanic can do unnoticed because it's only usable in one of three control methods. pls solve. i suggest adding more times when you have to choose to refuel or something else (when two stations are adjacent and you can't visit both). this will add choices. if i hit stuff, i don't know if i get or lose coins. make them magnet to car or lay on ground
c s : updt: i solved the prob with tofuyama not loading (still froze with new patch)... my home router's privacy filter was blocking whatever address the game needed to temporarily connect to. after that, my car showed up with tofuyama selected, and i was able to play the map. wonderful spring time effects! such a great casual racing game that's worth playing made by a great dev! request: please add my car? the 1993 pontiac firebird "", w/ coolness upgrade resembling a '98 transam w/ ram-air
zap man : a unique spin on runners. most running games have 3 lanes you travel on with collectables throughout the route and the idea is to get a highscore. this is true of #drive aswell however because we are driving a car you have more freedom of movement and really have a chance to pull off some risky stunts. i think the car physics makes this the best runner game i've played. i also purchased the full version which removes ads and helps to progress faster.
biggshiggs : a good game that only came across today and play for about 30 minutes, i can say it's pretty solid. the game makes the endless runner genre actually endless, power ups and upgrades feel like they actually have weight and matter a ton and there's plenty of cars and stages (for now.) for a really good playing experience. i would totally recommend this if you're looking for a medium type challenge and a good endless driving game.
brandon lyle : i enjoy it. i would enjoy it more if it were online and could race against other players. more options of cars and different upgrades so that everyone's cars are different. would be better if there were roads that split spots not just one continuous road. and a few other things but it's decent.
dodantheboss : i gotta say, the black bars that give it that '70's look' aint that bad, the cars that you can get is good, maybe add the typical delorean, or the 'hop on the flatbed lets roll truck' etc. the cars steering is a bit to sensitiv, the drifting is good,aswell as the level designs, but i'd like that you dont add a possibility to keep on going after you die, so that you have to restart. good game. -lol
gerhard scorgie : at first i played it i didn't like it but a couple of months later (now) i actually love it ,yes the car is hard to control but that's just a few upgrades away from being fixed. i love how you drive past something or a part of town and he says something about it . and the camera mode is a pretty cool feature and the art style is awesome in my eyes . good game .
vwvento schwarz : this game is fantastic! i second ail the praise that everyone else has been showering over this game before me and have zero complaints about the steering. what i wish in terms of game development for the future are more challenges and maybe an artificial intelligence opponent to drive against mode. also, i would like to have my driven kilometers in the trip stats. and i think the changeable parameters in the garage should be 1. brakes, 2. toughness, 3. grip. i love you guys!
mfxm : i was like: "they want rating? they get rating!" i think that out of millions of millions of millions of games i've tested this is the most addicting cartoon-style high quality car game i've ever seen. at the point of posting this this i'm grinding for a 20500 cork worth porsche with the coolness mode on.
tristan wragge : i have just started playing and it is such a good game i can tell already, the controller and mechanics are simple but difficult, and there is so much to unlock and do, a good time waster
chandni khan : this game is a very good time killing game and the controls are very easy to understand. i just love playing in the zen mode and i would recomment you to play it to. #drive
catre 12 : after so many hours i have found a nice game to play playing experience was really fun. and it's got pretty great cars and drive experience. nice job on it.
beena purohit : everything is good but i want these things change like choose a map like japan, but score dashboard show's you have donuts instead of onigiri please change the icons of donut on dashboard like uk- rock candy, asia- coconut,etc. overall the best timekiller game since when this game have only 16 cars and now there are 85 or something cars, please add an ancient india map too..
xavier mcleod : great graphics. cool range of cars. loads if sick maps. just an amazing game in general and it's really fun to play.
blake stepaniak : fun game, enjoyable and optional ads for the most part. have only had one not optional but it was skippable. overall a good, easy to play game
sebastian spreutels : this game has improved so much since i downloaded it. it's fun, challenging, and feels rewarding to get mew cars and upgrades.
najdan gazibaric : simple, runs smooth, getting money isn't tedious, it's runs offline as well shich is very nice. definetly recommend you give it a shot.
sofronii dimitrov : i love the animation and attention to detail in each map and i love the diversity with each car and obstacle. 10/10 would reccomend.
brandon njamba : love the game it has a lot of cars to use,easy to play and most of all it's unique.but the police could be better,like if u don't have the donut they could chase you until you give them a donut.
paballo01 mabaso : man this game is awesome!!! i like it this game it's even better than asphalt 8 more like information on that game and this game it's cool it has so many fast and furious car and the best part is that you can decared your own dream car my dream car is a mclaren gtr because it's the fastest
fuk yu : ads or no ads, it is beautiful, calm and relaxing. must have if you want moderately unsofisticated and fun endless racing game about open road.
supersmoothie s : very fun, quite a challenge, happy there is a zen mode! the maps are beautiful and casual driving is very calming
simone dc : not your usual endless driving game, it is challenging and hard and makes you want to reach the goals that the game offers you, great choices of car, the fastest one is not always the best one. the controls are weird but you get used to, the graphics is awesome and the gamelay is fantastic. love it
sean schaefer : this is one of the best mobile games i've played in a long time. the endless driving gameplay i very fun and addictive. the game also looks great and the graphics have a lot of character. they also don't shove micro transactions in your face like many other mobile games do and the ads are very short. this is everything a good mobile game should be.
matthew g : excellent game, i love the tracks and the weekly cars are great. the 'coolness' on every car is brilliant too, although for the customisation it would be good if you could adjust suspension and add a full colour wheel, not just four colours. also it would be great for the next track if it was more hilly and harder, i thought rio de janeiro would be cool. i would highly recommend the game
the user : of course the game is excellent the way it is, but my problem playing this game is just the behavior of the car while actually playing it on the road, i mean the way it turn left to right, its very sensitive so i don't enjoy the game and ended up uninstalling it, but yeah some user enjoy it. if you guys, your team fix/changed this it would be awesome and i will be happy for that then back to play the game again. thank you if you guys did.
zacky bibo : it was a nice game, pretty smooth animations
alex i : the thing you see from the very beginning: this game is made with so much love! subtle jokes, lovely car models, funny car and places names. it is worth every cent and the price for an ad-free experience is very decent. yes, the steering is little tough, but it is an arcade on a phone, so i'm good with that. great game, guys, thank you!
ryanthehero : #drive is one of the most unique retro styled games out there, the graphics and effects blend into each other as if they were colours. the car selection is pretty good, and there are a lot of movie culture references in there. i would recommend this game to anyone passing by!
snipedude500 : race game with minimal ad, good game yes
daniel somodi : this game is amazing, i love that you still have access to the entire game even offline, the 3d graphics have a phenomenal style and vibe to them. this game almost feels like an indie adventure game, the controls are so basic yet so awesome and i love that you can also use a controller with the game as well just in case you do not want to the also amazing touch screen controls with the adjustable sensitivity. this is by far the greatest feeling driving game of all time, if u r reading this getit
dunialuar : the game is great, graphics are nice, lots of beautiful car and the gameplay is also fun, only downside is there is no other gameplay variety beside driving as far as you can, maybe if you add a new game mode and add further progression system, i think this game would be a lot more fun to play, oh and please add new location!, there's only a few
sealand itisi : this game has been pretty good so far. i will admit that i only picked it up because the starting car resembles the trueno, but ut has fun drifting and game goals. it's definitely worth playing. i play it a little bit a day, so it's more of a on/off game. easy to pick up for short bursts. suggestion, though, next map needs to be japan: akina pass. that would make this game perfect.
satish vishwakarma : this is the most creative game ever !! you will find this game completely unique. there are a lot of new stuff in this game which makes it outstanding. the graphics are exquisite. the cars in this game make it extraordinary. when you play this game, you will realise the team's efforts behind it. this is entirely a different experience than other driving games. i also suggest to add more camera angles for the gameplay. also, please make the controls easier. magnificent game !!
manikanta g. : this game is fun and hard at the same time. background music and voice is awesome. ads are shown only when you ask for.
vishnu prakash : a lot of reviews talk about the controls, i think its obvious created for the slight realism. each car behaves differently based on its primary/basic state, each upgrade can cause a collosal difference to its performance and the surface in which its currently on also makes a difference. i also feel that each location also causes the car to act differently. the physics, and the mechanics are extremly polished - allowing for serious gameplay. just need more stages and a bigger draw distance.
juan manrique fas : so far pretty good game. there is a lot of cars and there is progression between maps just by playing. same with leveling up which at certain levels it earns you new vehicles. as of now 44 vehicles are in, and all are based from real life models, with a silly name instead of the real one.
fabian : it's a entertaining game. i like it, like, a lot. it does have some good sides and some bad sides. one of the good thing is that you can never get bored because the level is allways changing and is never ending. the handeling is a bit janky but thats about it. the game allmost doesn't have any ads. i would recomend it.
colin murphy : what an exceptional driving game. superb graphics, excellent voice overs ( if the dev could add a few more in the future it would be appreciated ) great locations to drive through (more to come soon, i hope) plenty of cars to add to your driving experience (via coins earned, but you can accumulate them very easily) wish all games were as good as this one. many thanks!
robert pawlik : responsive controls, decent graphics, enjoyable gameplay, ads don't appear too often
elyar nova : there are a couple of elements which make this game really interesting one of them which personally i really adore are both the graphics and the special difficult controls. like as i've mentioned before there are more specialities in this game but the two i mentioned earlier, i think stand above the rest. however, i really want to thank the developers of this game for creatating such a unique experience.
luis zambrano : this game is great, the fact that it has cars inspired by real cars makes it even better! it is great for passing time
josh ferguson : absolutely love this game, especially since the update, this game is so well polished and is beautifully simple to play, takes a little time to get used to the game mechanics but there's heaps of different cars that all handle differently, so if you're having trouble, try another car, and the addition of the learner track is also awesome for new drivers, cant wait to see more updates to come, awesome game
lego star wars jango fett : beatiful game indeed. i love the visuals and it's simple style. the gameplay feels original and there's a great variety of cars to choose from. i like the how the "cool" mode looks on every car. i have just started playing and defivinetly recommend it.
monika raphtalia asuma : the game is challenging, especially on tofuyama, but i can't drift too much because of traffic which is fine. the music on every location really fits. a fine additional features to the game is to have damage when my car getting hit by a cop car just in case the donut didn't get. new locations and cars.
karl nievesson : i love it, low adds and its very simple to play. i love the custom of its vehicles and the upgrades that can be done. maps are fun and with its fuel and donuts pick ups during the game play and with more things to do is awesome. the sound quality, like perhaps ambiem and weather could use improvement and perhaps adding animals or things in the middle of the way could be more ideal. cool game
ethan duncan : nice game, really cool mechanics and graphics
ramish anwar : love this game, it took me some time to get the controls down but after that it's really really fun! love the cars, the maps, the physics everything, if anything can be improved is a little on the physics, i'd love to be able to reverse 360 entry
kurameshi yusuke : amazing game,the graphics are fire and gameplay is nice and clean good for long rides if i do say so my self but yeah amazing game to play.
damien alvarez : this game is really fun when your bored. it is very entertaining game to play.
taylor noel : controls are nice. simple, but complex enough to feel a sense of improvement as you play. the artstyle is nice, and i like the music too. also super cool is the attention to all these older cars which get a lot less attention in video games. all in all pretty fun time killer. great for a roadtrip!
mark lukban : it's frustrating and addicting. one of my favorite mobile games. i'd get it for pc and console too if i could.
ayushi singh : wow. this game, this game is just out of this world. amazing graphics, easy controls, gives you those '70s and '80s vibes as said by the developers, and just a great experience overall. if i'd have to suggest something i'd say maybe add a few different types of passengers, like a scared guy, a sassy girl, or some guy who loves to eat? it makes it all interesting.
gabriel boston : this game is amazing. the cars are beautifully designed and well done. i love the maps. i do have 2 suggestions. 1: make the photo mode wwwaaayyy less sensitive. 2: i have an idea for a map: bayport. it should be a beach map set in hawaii. those are my suggestions. otherwise, great game! keep up the good work!
yash jha : thank you pixel studios for making such a mind blowing game good graphics in starting controls was tough but after 2 to 3 times i got my hand over it. all locations catches my eyes and attention cars are fabulous. just want to give 1 suggestions that try to give 1st person view just like the driver see from inside the car and let the controls like that only plzz accept my request towards your game. thank you.
vojta kuscak : the controls might be somewhat hard to master but once you get the hang of it, it's super fun. the only thing i have with this game is the fact that buying it unlocks all cars and tracks, which kind of removes any motivation to level up and grind for the next car you want.
bernard yap : been playing this since it launched and it keeps getting better and better. easily one of my top favorites on mobile. love the art style, overall theming, voiceovers, soundtrack and expanding vehicle selection. definitely recommend to anyone even if you aren't into cars.
mahesh kumar : i would love it if the roads were more wider. there are so many exciting cars but it is very difficult to earn coins for every vehicle, which is a big drawback. will be very exciting if we can see a different location or major changes in the soroundings after reaching a certain distance, like 1000m/700m. doghnuts- fully inside the footpath in some maps. police- good inclusion but no role (just chasing). wud like to see some more interesting concepts,like picking up a friend who does something.tq
vincent johnson : nice simple pick up and play.
friendzoned guy : i'm astonished. this is my best endless racing with low poly tooned car models, detailed areas/cities. the controls are fine, car handles a bit slidy, but that makes it challenging (but i know most people like easy to handle cars, which sucks). the car still shakes even on asphalt, you might wanna fix that (car should only shake on off-road terrain). i might wanna request for the bumper weapon to not only a plower type, could add a new weapon like rocket/something that shoots traffic car away
adam olejniczak : outstanding. takes a while to learn how to drive but once you do it's amazing addictive fun you can jump i and out of. physics are great, each car is different which makes it fun, graphics and animations are smooth, challange rambs up the longer you drive. you strive to drive for longer and beat a score. works completley offline too so you can play on plane etc. wish you could give it 6 starts.
debasruto maity : if you're looking for a minimalistic themed endless driving game with decent graphics, then this is the perfect choice. it takes time to get the hang of it, but when you do, it's enjoyable. i would request the developers to add more such immersive tracks to drive on.
darleen dumaguin : i'm loving it so far. the game looks great, smooth ui, and the controls seem just right to me. people complaining about the sensitivity should probably try tapping lighter instead of jamming their finger onto the screen. keep up the great work!
james luciano : like this game but sometimes phone it's so lag because he can't handle bigger gb or mb
john frederik alvendia : great game! would suggest to tweak the controls a bit because there are time that you can't steer when throwing doughnuts. but overall an epic car casual arcade. a+ mechanics, a+ graphics/ artwork. i would also like to suggest more cars for specific maps i.e. japan map could use more japanese cars. this game is a blast! highly recommendable!
grimm ii : 10/10. i haven't even gotten past the first 'level' yet, but i suppose thats a personal issue haha. very fun game, the voice acting makes it more enjoyable, the physics are great and not tough by any means. very good time killer in a bite size, 70mb package which is also a plus. looking forward to more levels, cars, and i have my hopes up for some car upgrades in the future, both in visuals and tuning. great game, would recommend to anyone that finds themselves in need of a boredom killer.
game boy : i love it but plzz improve the steering options
coz efekt : this game is perhaps one of the best i've played. if it were on console, i'd play for days, i enjoy the graphics, the controls, and the vehicle choices. it's smooth and fun for passing time and for those who don't want to worry about score, zen mode is a nice kickback mode for a calm, yet still fun experience.
team619 : simply the best arcade plus+ time killer . most of the review about controls . it needs to be fixed . but irecommend everyone to put the control setting to 3rd,its perfect .. and to the developers ... please add a lan wifi multiplayer. so we can play with friends . add some new generation cars . every thing is perfect
akogwu p johnson : the game is nice the graphic is good and also the control work's perfectly.i just like the game.
marc concepcion : this is a classic arcade game experience! simple game mechanics, even simpler controls, and graphics and "story" that doesn't take itself too seriously! for the price of admission to remove ads, the grind is balanced well with the game's progression. a great mobile gaming experience that you can hop on and off early during your daily commute!
flying peel tanks /w 5000hp : great offline game, fun choices, definitely recommend, and they're no pay to win. i just wish they're be more cars.
olivia s. s : overall this game is very great. the control look like easy, but its a bit hard. simple control, no many button. the graphic was so good , and it's look 3d for me. the car was great and many choices for the car. yeah, the game is recommended. thank you.
crystal v : it's great. but the controls are extremely hard, but that's what i like about the game! i like me a good challenge!
ahnaf jamil : not to sound like a bot but.. its almost perfection. music is great, graphics and art style are fresh and beautifull. there is nothing i can say is bad about this game. it lags a little but thats just my phone's problem. overall one of the best racing games on play store
sergiy boyarchuk : fun. enjoyable. relaxing. great game what so ever. just... would wanted to ask about adding a bit more cars, a bit more tracks, some changeable music (maybe even radio stations) and last but not least - a bit more avatars! that's would be wonderful at all!!! ride safe to all!!!
riel mallorca : this game is sooooo good. you can play it offline, you can play online and this game does not force tou to watch ads. you have an option to watch the ads and the ads prize is worth it. just keep adding cars. :)))))
sean watson : love this game, it's very fun, plays great and looks nice. one thing that i would highly appreciate and think you should do is change the design of the cop car chasing you in london to a uk traffic police style car. it would make the game a lot more enjoyable and i really think you should do it in a future update, it would be cool.
wylie s : very smooth racing game with an at times funny story! win for me! edit: tried to pick up again after a bit and it says "max out coolness" used up all my caps to try to "max" out! won't let me race, unless i'm missing the race button i can't play anymore, oh well uninstalling please fix! edit: (reinstalled) since last update, haven't had the maxed coolness bug yet.. solid 5 stars!
dillan brooks : only review i made for a mobile game. fun and engaging gameplay, ads are pretty infrequent and aren't annoying, and you don't really need the expensive vehicles to do well. definitely worth a try at least.
czack efron : i'll definitely gonna rate this 5 stars!! game is nice and simple controls make it easy and graphics is great but i wish i can skip or change tasks of levels cause i'm stuck with 7th level it's says i need to drift for 5 secs but it's too hard cause it's difficult to find a drifting place pls add those and i'll tell this game to my friends.
miguel creel : this is by far the best driving game that i have found on mobile since 3 years ago. i love this game and i love the variety of cars you can choose from. the controls are very easy to use and have the perfect sensitivity for this kind of game. i do wish that there were more than 4 colors to choose from (i might have just missed a button to show more colors) but this is a great driving game and i recommend it to everyone.
tylee fontenot : great game doesn't take alot of skill barely any ads and doesn't take long to get new cars, wonderful game also great graphics
nathan ferne : really fun game, my favorite mobile game. driving physics are solid, the cars feel different and are fun to try out on different tracks. updates roll out pretty often and have been doing so for years. has controller support. my only complaint is it seems to stutter just a tiny bit on my phone (razer phone ii) and not on my tablet, even though the phone has much better specs. such is life. love the game though so still 5 stars.
adi ctrl : i would like to zoom in camera, also if it could be posibel to have view perspective from the hud. i've tried driving in oposite direction and i have noticed that programmers had limited this probably for good reasons, but anyway it would be fun if i could drive around the gas station for example, instead of just not alowing the player to steer after a cerain degree. 5 stars from me.
niranjan rajeev : nice game but hard to control the vehicle
xchara fan : it's a very fun game to play when you're bored or just want to play a good mobile game
mccloudy : such a chill game. the in-game transactions are really in-expensive too.
benjamin fraser-macfarlane : this game is fantastically simple. elegant ui, beautiful graphics and simple gameplay make for a 5/5 casual game experience. with easy to learn, hard to master game mechanics this game will keep you hooked. also no ads with google playpass unless you are receiving a direct benefit and no play to win features as such. just you, your car and miles of road for endless fun. please keep developing and maintaining this game as it is an underated legend.
adedimeji sebiotimo : great game,. the mechanics take some time to get used to, especially drifting, but the game play is very enjoyable. i'd like to see more missions to unlock more vehicles, and more difference in the vehicle handling and their use in the different locations.
lucian : awesome! good graphics good game play, love it!
jiraiya hermit : fantastic experience. all the cars are within affordable capacity and may all be unlocked just by persistent playing. all the maps are distinct. highly reccomend. all i request is more colour schemes, and increased threat from cop cars (perhaps extra bump damage). and more maps, please! please!
marcy upp : this game is a classic and a classic that never seems to disappoint me
sinviper : overall, #drive is a fantastic and well rounded game. with multiple maps and vehicles to choose from its hard to get bored of playing. the graphics are very nice and fit the theme well. cars are consistent and hold up to the theme. controls and gameplay are fantastic. and with new weekly updates and a amazing community, theres not much more to ask for. a solid 5 stars from me.
racer gaming : very good game but we would like to customize our cars by adding bumpers , extra lights , roof rack , extra tyres , and more
ryan morrison : fun game lots of cars gud controls and gud graphic
monitor : great and love the graphics. can't expect anything else, you just drive and get scores and more.
rinata 39 : i have to say, i've only been playing the game for a little while and the sheer amount of detail put into this game is insane, i love the vehicle mechanics and the drifting and how your car performs different on dirt and road and other ground. truly a lovely game i'll continue playing. i love car games and this will satisfy my cravings for a while.
dudeman brochief : it's a solid game if you're into the "left/right tap" landscape type game. it's got mario-quality timing. this game could be less ad-intrusive, due to the temptations in the game. but alas, like so many good to really-good games, the ads will be annoying unless you spend. the game itself does not need you to spend. just try it. i'll spend cash to unlock at some point, once i get tired of the kart game that involves said mario bloke.
saayam chowdhury : if u don't like this game for its controls, i would say u should practice. best arcade driving. it has a large collection of vintage cars. which u can buy with caps. and maps which is bought outta different currency, postcard, recieved by visiting towns. it has secret missions, secret coolness, and a bit unfriendly for first timers. but practice will make yeh perfect. absolutely recommended!
anthony jones : super fun to waste time. no need for wifi and is great for road trips.
joe perez : the cars look nice and the graphics
prithvi_ raj : wow what a perfect game. this is my all time favourite game. it has many cars. plenty of upgrades and you can chose colors too. i will want to suggest two things 1) like you have mini cars, basic cars, dirt cars, speed cars etc just like that pls add muscle cars for example 1970 dodge charger, 1971 plymouth roadrunner gtx. (as i am a fast and furious series fan) 2) you have places like dry crumbs, snow plow, la mirabelle just like that add some places which will have beach view. thank you
ah h : good old simple driving game remenicent of the days gone by. graphic design is great, with this lovely retro-modern vibe; some of the car's "coolness" modification is no less than hilarious; the 8 maps are distinctive and rather true to real life, but could do with some more. excellent game if some simple driving is what you want.
ahmed noushad : loved everything about it. just the controls a littlr bit clumay. i guess that's part of the game? but a little better control could be hoped for. everything else, the graphics, the music, the drive comments all up the top.
shirapthi kaushik : nice graphics. good collection of cars. more creative maps can be added.
jsh strke : i quite like the graphics and the styling of the game, although i wish the car could take more than one head-on collision, or that there was a way to slow down to squeeze through tight gaps. the 5 new cars are great, i'm rocking the 3-wheeler!
brandon f : i have lots of fun playing this game! i enjoy its art style and driving physics. its seems easy to play, but hard to master. the ads do beat you over the head, but they don't interrupt gameplay. i did pay to remove the ads, but i feel like i'll be playing this game a for a little while, so it's worth it to me. i just wish there was a category to show the vehicles you own, instead of having to cycle through so many other stuff just to find what you want. all in all, i would recommend.
greg wheeler : #drive has been made with some love. the artwork is full of humour, with super-clean retro design throughout. gameplay is great on sony xperia xz with loads of cars and plenty of tarmac to explore. i had a few issues following a reinstall, but an email to the developer had the problem resolved within a few days. highly recommended!
lazaros : i don't normally write reviews but this is an exceptional game. minimal ads, awesome atmosphere, a relaxing zen mode, tons to unlock. this has the whole package. the car models chosen are so cool since there are european car icons. enough with all the mustangs! my thanks to the developers!
bokhal : really fun game and hard at the same time
t woods : i've been a loyal player since you dropped this game and it's literally the only driving game i'll download whenever i get a new phone. i love everything about this game and the mechanics behind it. i also appreciate how 8-9 times out of ten y'all add a new car and/or map! my only thing two suggestions would be to add a ghost chaser mode (if that makes sense) and to add two cars- '95 toyota mr2 and a apollo s gumpert :d otherwise keep it up the great work! i hope to see those cars one day
riesta gema : it's a fun game. another kind of driving game experience, graphics great, simple gameplay and of course the cars is great as well. *note: please fix the bug/error house that placed in the middle of the road in holzberg track.
not pixl : love the game's style, selection of cars, and how performance-friendly it is. the ads are a tad annoying but aren't intrusive. love how active this game is updated, devs working away to keep this game up to shape! the discord is full of amazing people reporting bugs and enjoying the game, furthermore helping devs. can't wait for more content in the game!
andy vargas : this game looks just so gorgeous! and its so much fun! really well artistically planed! should ad more dramatic/spectacular crashes, or the ability to rotate a bit the camera after you crash to peek around, the environments are really gorgeous would love to see everything! so much great job! for artist and programmers and everyone !
zila the man : best game ever,i think you should and the cars because most of cars are old other than that is the best.
krzysztof setlak : i'm honestly impressed with the quality of the game. it's simple, easy to learn, hard to master - just as a mobile game should be. and the quality of 3d models, overall feel, attention to detail... among other mobile games this one is certainly top league.
bobaggins gameing : fun game just some anoying adds here and there
christopher gibson : absolutely gorgeous graphics... easy to play, hard to master. note: turn down sensitivity in "pause" menu for easier handling... maybe turn it back up when you get more confident and need quicker reactions as the game progresses.
ethan irvin : very good game! not hard to get the hang of
shannon goodwin : i like that you can drive like it is an arcade game but i'm hoping not too much car will cost alot of coins in the game
cheryl n : it's an amazing game plus i can drift in the tofuyama map in japan!
antonio dias : it's hard to find some good games on thing store unless you go to top rated, paid but other then that there are no real ways to find a good game. when i found this i was skeptical but now it's my #2 most used app. simplistic game play/graphics which makes it the best casual game to play when you are bored/offline. not many ads i think but hey you have to make money somehow. zen mode make it a way to calm down having a nice drive and pro cam may sound menacing mut is probably the best way to play the game (it should be renamed to fixed cam because that makes more sence). this is a pretty great game and has a full recommendation to almost anyone.
carl cashman : good game plain and simple. graphics are perfect for this being a fun game and i like the controls once you get used to them. a lot of things to achieve and vehicles to buy so you won't get bored or clock it too soon. i'd like to see a little more customisation options like wheels or more of a colour palette in future updates
xander thompson : the controls are simple, but this game is challenging to master right. very fun game with a fun selection of vehicle types and new choices always being added! still loving all of the vehicle and location additions, keep up the great work!
- nameless nomad - : i've played this game on and off for the past year or so, and it's great. easy to pick up and waste some time on and actually enjoy said time. great catalog of cars, which grows with each update. suggestion : a "no traffic mode", sort of like the zen mode, no need to worry about fuel, repairs, cops or traffic, just an endless drive, especially on maps like tofuyama, so i can drift without worrying about dodging cars and so i can tear it up on the moutain pass section.
thefrkoby : this games is the perfect game for you when you do not have internet
kaji thatotherguy : great fun! light on battery, great models. good to waste a few moments and even if you end a play early you don't lose out, you still get postcards and caps. would only ask for appropriate police sirens for areas. little authenticity. but i'm nitpicking. go play it already!
king ironfist : #drive is a fun driving game. i enjoy plowing through cars as i'm sliding through the towns. excited and hopeful to see new towns pop up and possibly new power ups? visually appealing and the controls are simple. thanks for the game. could you maybe add a town with holes in the road or like ramps... :)
hand : entertaining and fluid pretty good if you ask me and i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes endless runners.
shaik sazeer : loved the game but ads are bit annoying please reduce ads and i was very much impressed with the graphics what it have. it would be better if you add some other camera view for this game ,cars looks far from screen
danny kime : its a pretty decent game. i like the scenery and the challenge of driving through a gas station is risky yet rewarding. the controls are ok but i dont like how the camera moves with the car. apart from that, i love this game, super fun!
robin timms : cool game. looks and sounds amazing. a classic old school style driving game.
stephen jacques : i discovered this game by pure chance on social media and thought it had nice aesthetics...but assumed it might have been a switch or xbox game, and not available for playstation...happy to discover is was in fact an android game! perfect for my new 21:9 xperia 1, and it runs perfectly, plays perfectly as a casual mobile racing game... the art style is on point i only hope there is more to come
rafky fauzan : simple, yet addictive. ads are surprisingly not intrusive at all (of course you can just play with internet off), and all the cars are easily accessible by simply playing (no p2w mumbojumbo). the immersive atmosphere and funky ost tops it all off. would love to get more maps to drive at though. also the photomode is simply awesome!
william cheng : fun, low stress way to pass the time. graphics and animation are high quality, music is bouncy and spirited, and there's just enough challenge to keep me coming back. ended up paying for the ad free version.
rowen krampf : good looking graphics, awesome music and enjoyable game play, with a good variety of different cars many being obvious and funny references to real models. i like the zen mode which allows one to get better accustomed to the controls or simply enjoy a more casual game. all around a great driving game.
real gamer 20 : very very relaxing game, in the category of drive ,ever made . controls are very very responsive. and there are not so many controls ,so gamers can enjoy full view and adventure . graphics is slightly different and lot like a driving world ,so we feel like we are coming in a adventure driving world............... the interesting thing about it that we can play it offline this is the very interesting thing that i found in this game and there are no ads
aarif iqbal : simply beautiful. apart from the stunning visuals, the controls are what makes it more interesting. it has huge potential and a massive expansion along with online multiplayer support in future would do true justice to it. just imagine something like this in an open world setting.
a grave misunderstanding : for a game about evading the police and speeding, this game is really chill, not only that but you can really tell the devs put their heart into this game, the voice acting (what little of it there is) is fun and we'll acted, the art is unique and adds to the style although the dust trail is a weak point in my opinion. there are obviously adds but they don't feel that intrusive and there aren't any paywalls. progression is a little slow but the game is fun in all stages. give it a try
pete : really good graphics, great gameplay if you want to use up an hour-or-so. it's definitely one i'll keep coming back to. the only thing i would change would be the voice; either bring in another one or add more phrases. great selection of cars!
nicholas martin : love gfx, ui and mechanics. pretty cool stuff!
shin jon : best game great graphics and nice background music overall great game. love this game and it's developer who has created this game..
kai tyas : great driving app, the touch controls are a bit sensitive. i don't know if there is a way to change the sensitivity but if there isnt, i would love to have that put in. but other than that it's a great endless runner
edward sutton jr : awesome game first of!! fantastix job devs! however, there's an opportunity here, especially with auto acceleration, to have a portrait orientation mode for quick, one handed, on the go, awesomeness!! please consider this. it would take this game to another level!
daniel marton : perfect example of easy to learn hard to master games. easy controls and in-game tasks, yet no boring at all. graphics are simple but entertaining. every item as far as i know can be bought just by playing the game. it is a well done game.
good question : i would say in my opinion its a good game the retro style and easy to grasp controls the game is nice.its one of those games that you only play for a little while before uninstalling but sometimes you keep the game for a bit longer and it starts to feel good.all around good game with nice graphics easy controls and retro design.
aaron volcic : game is very well designed, the art is really good. they have a lot of cars in the game, my personal favorite car is the mail box with the coolness upgrade, it turns really well and when it takes damage it gets boosted.
anmol sharma : the best game i have ever played on android, i wanted a game like this for years thank you so much for creating this. but, i have some requests... 1. please add a tilt control support, touch control is kinda hard for me as i've been playing mobile racing games with tilt controls 2. please make that coin pickups icon smaller, it is huge and it kinda makes it difficult to see whats going on in the later levels... please bring these 2 changes in the next update
yuka [gd] : this game is good and chill i like the car physics and the graphics of the game it looks simple but the shadows color makes it more good the control is easy but there's is a bug at tofuyama map,so when you drift sometimes the car just sink into the road and you crashed please fix that bug because it's kinda annoying.
rodney lanning : really fun game, challenging with a great selection of vehicles and great looking graphics. i just downloaded a few days ago, but so far it is one of the coolest mobile games that i have played, and i would recomend it to anyone who is a fan of racing games and classic, iconic cars.
anastasia bielievitina : this game has such a smooth graphics, i love its color spectrum which is so relaxing and control is pretty convenient. i can't wait for new locations to be added, it's really enjoyable and deserves the highest rate. keep it simple, keep it up
loading _ : apart from the backseat driver this game is a great passtime and good for friendly competition to see how far you can go, controls are simple and easy to pick up as well as the cars that are clearly based on real world designs so good for a car enthusiast like myself
cj imperial : easily one of the greatest games for mobile great sounds great cars great graphics it's just so perfect. i'll say though that it gets grindy but it's kind worth in my opinion the controls are simple too. i hope you continue developing this game. and take some rest.
ryan tirtajaya : i've played for 5mins and i feel the quality of the game is worth to pay to remove ads. ads are really long, 30 seconds, and it's really fun skill game that is easy to die in if you don't focus which could result in you watching ads really frequently.
elijah vincent : now this is what a good free game should be! especially with the inclusion of zen mode! more games like this please! no more garbage like gardenscapes scamming you with their false and shady advertisments! the only time you see ads are when you aren't playing and i, for one, greatly appreciate the developers for appropriately placing the ads! great soundtrack, pleasing scenery and good atmosphere creates a solid fun experience!
ohm vyas : very minimalistic yet stylish game with great features and reasonable advancements. although there r many ads, there isn't a troublesome amount which is something that makes this game good. i also love the graphics of this game as it looks very nice.
frederick nicholas : nice app, not too many adds and they're all skippable anyways. the premise is simple and the controls are easy, very nice game. collecting caps takes forever, though, but that's just part of the game and my own lack of skill.
michal linke : it's a really great endless... driver. tons of cars to unlock, every single one of them made with love, meticulously designed, with character. this game can last you years until you unlock everything! only one, cheap iap to get rid of not even that annoying ads. i recommend it fully!
shikhar garg : this is a wonderful game with minimalistic graphics and nice look and feel with comments coming through the journey. plus the motion thing in the garage is just amazing . never seen anywhere else. 3 cheers to the development team and all others who have worked on it
mocha : simple driving game and the drifting is fun. the compulsory ads are quite irritating and i paid to get rid of them. there should be more rewards with objectives to make players stay with the game, rather just collecting bottle caps. more features will be welcome. hope more update will come soon.
erik choong : nice little time killer. gives you that "one more time" kind of feeling. plenty of cars to unlock. but upgrading doesn't quite make any difference to the vehicle that is noticeable. still, that doesn't dampen the experience. keep improving devs.
surya kiran ss : absolutely superb.this game will give you a cute and unique gameplay experience!! each map is crafted carefully and extremely detailed. that soothing voices gives a special kind of pleasure when driving the car. car garage is also endless!! plenty of cars with special features and styles would never make you feel bad try it. my fav.
pratik anand : brilliant. it's just brilliant. free-to-play, interesting gameplay mechanics, attractive graphics. tons of cars, detailed maps, and most importantly there's the zen mode for relaxed gameplay. great work developers, wish i could find more such games.
jason patrick : absolutely loving this little endless driver! the visuals are top notch and hearken back to the days of auto modellista. each car handles differently which makes unlocking new vehicles feel like more than just a visual upgrade. highly recommend!
robert : honestly, just a real addicting game. everything is good at getting used to. i did notice a slight problem though. this happened once so far, but while i was driving, this wall made out of the houses on the side blocked the road. i was driving on the german map.
the moover : ive played this game before and it was awsome. i just was wondering though if u could have a racing mode because i think the cars would look great next to each other. have it same style and bit like fpv racing but samw style you have already with the racing aspect. the game looks amazin i just wanted to see you guys take it to that next step.
jeff jeffson : listen, i'm not into driving games, they're not really my cup of tea. however, this game is really good! nice graphics, pretty good controls, and some nice cars and locations to obtain. i recommend this game to anyone who wants a good and (somewhat) calm mobile game to play.
bloatedgopher : ads are a bit bothersome if you are looking for a strickly free game, but it gives you a chance to try it out. i was enjoying myself enough that i sprung for the $3.49 to turn them off and now the game is much more fun without getting your rythym broken to watch an ad everytime you want to drive or need to reset.
aleksander stojanowski : game is really nice, but i noticed some bug. when you start a map, but before you gain control on car, you can start drifting (without moving a car) and before game starts you have multiplier 2 or even 3.
art deco city architecture : there are games that care, and games that use there good effort for bad usage...this game has the care and the graphics which is a gift unforseen to all. i haven't found many games that actually give you cars older then 1982 so this is an otherworldly insanely well loved with care treat of a game. my only intervention to this would be more genre from the past, 30s, 40s and definitely 50s. and some big 70s sedans, the classic cadillacs, oldsmobile, mercury, ltd, you name it!
p c : what a great game. performance on mid range devices is awesome, graphics look great and is super addictive. also love the small little touches such as throwing the donut at the police, adding bodykits to the car and lines of dialogue make the game even better.
mira valdez : a great offline game when you're bored. loved the voice acting and the graphics. the bgm fits the aesthetic as well. the animation is very smooth and the ads don't bother you that much. one of the best driving games i've played so far.
darkray8000 : extremely fun game to play. the art and graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is very smooth. it's fun and enjoyable to explore the maps and drive the cars considering purchasing the removal of ads if the price was to go down a pound. (3.49 is a bit too much)
owen shipp : left and right steering buttons. press both to brake. icons warn you of parking lots to slown for so you can drift through a drive through collecting gas. repairs. mystery upgrades and donuts to throw at cops to distract them. fun dialog. the game is good. if you like music tiles. or subway surfer. you might like this one too.
tejas singh : this game is amazing!! literally every aspect of it is perfect- the controls, cars, boosters. and the music and vocal commentary is pretty great too! there's quite a bit of diversity where the zones/areas you can drive in is concerned, and i loved that too!!
winston blue : great gameplay, beautiful visual style and audio, just got everything a mobile game gotta have. bought the no ad version in my first gameplay, feels nice to support people making good games. i would like to be able to change cars more detailed visually like rims etc. also a better icon for the game wouldnt hurt.
axel caron : so far the best game i ever installed on my phone. cool graphics, easy to understand, loads of things to unlock. difficulty doesn't just go from so easy it's boring to impossible, it stays possible while giving you a challenge. pretty good game basically
raunak : i payed for the "unlock all perk" and i'm very glad i did, very addictive game and not in a bad way, better than almost all endless runners out there but this ain't an endless runner in the traditional sense. if you like driving and 70s driving movies this is the game for you. not to mention how beautiful this game looks.
brictius sancti : epic little game will keep u smiling when u are offline. awesome graphics. awesome controls. drive to unlock your favorites among a huge selection of iconics cars from the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's, on easy or hard roads of england, france, germany, thailand, japan or mars and more. must have 5 stars game.
charles biddle : originally a one star. now the game is probably one of the best driving games i've played in the app store. below is my original complaint. i have a galaxy s8 and the game just flat out won't load up. i want to try. it looks like a blast but i can't even get to a start menu or anything.
headcase gaming : this game has charm out the wazoo. usually i'm not a big fan of endless runner games, but this one is an exception. all the cars are classics, and the unique logos for each car are perfectly stylish. the devs obviously put a lot of love into it, and that's something you don't see all the time.
remodox : actually quite fun. passes the time really well, the drive "button" takes time getting used to, it has an interesting way of "kind of" keep you playing since it's a bigger button than the "main menu" button, i always mistakenly press it all the time, thus i'm back in the game again lol all in all though quite a fun game, ohh and practice makes perfect. trust.
brian stephan : this game is awesome. i'm having issues purchasing the unlock all cars and tracks. nothing happens when i tap the price button. i would like to purchase the unlock all cars and tracks.
cmdr lekroil : the gameplay is cool , i liked that. i had a lot of fun playing it! so much cars , level of coolness. but most importantly , the voice of the driver. he speaks about everything. police , new level , close calls and many other things thank you developer for such a good game!
astro penguin : this is a well made game. super fun, easy to learn and it is an arcade style game (it goes on forever). i like how there is a zen mode. zen mode is... 1) no fuel 2) no cops 3) less traffic. i like the regular mode more but it's a good feature. this is a really well built game.
jako : great game, fairly simple controls, lovely graphics, the voice lines are funny, takes a little while to get used to the controls but it's still not that hard. if i could give it 10 stars i would.
kristijan koprivnjak : stellar game, a lot of work went into it and it shows, just one recommendation, draw distance is very short, it would be great if you could give us the option to increase the draw distance to view more of the gorgeous map
philip benz : i'm not good at this. if i were a little younger i think i could. i can barely pass the 2 min mark and then i crash. but i'm persistent because i like the game. it has an 80's vibe to it and it's worth keeping. if you could slow it down a notch in the first rounds that would be awesome.
conner sheckells : it's a relitivly simple game and it's a really good time killer. one thing i think could use some improvement is the car selection menu. maybe have a way to look through a list.nither than that i really like the game.
faris f.i frs : great ! the graphics are good, the controls are smooth, the music is cool, the designing is dope, and the best thing is : you can play it offline. (even though there would probably a bug happens to you)
angelos stavropoulos : amazing. i had so much fun and although the game is simple it gets so hard after a while. i like the missions and that the game has soo many cars and the option to upgrade them. it is simple but awesome 100/10
jan loven del rosario : this game is great! my statement on july 2019. now, its 2020 so many things have been added! im really glad of the new updates ever since i stopped playing this. it still has the same energy as it did before. the fun, memories, the grinding of cola coins. it really resonates with me, looking forward to the next updates!
guus lammertink : an amazingly fun gaming experience on mobile. the driving feels good, the drifting is incredibly fun and addictive, and there's enough content to keep you engaged. the references to car- and pop culture in the naming and customization of the cars is the cherry on this pie!
john carlo sarmiento : i love the game because this is not the other driving games that exploring the road to collect coins , beating the high s ores and repeatetive gameplay with no progress the game offers you a simple yet better graphics the gameplay is not boring there's a lot of exploring stuff happening in the game .the design of the game is superb spechless it's like the game back in my childhood when the cars have sharp edge formed like a paper car haha idunno what to say just download the game and enjoy
alwin baiju : i love how the graphics is there is a wide variety of cars i suggest the developers just one thing never add other cars just add the vintage ones. the graphics are the best i love how the game is designed and how the cars and maps are displayed the colour combination on the display is classic and i love it.. want the developers to create more games
that kyler : awsome. very fun and addicting game, it looks great with beautiful maps and lots of cars! the only thing i would suggest is give more coins after each run. it does take a while to get lots of coins.
zack metcalf : as a general rule, i don't like mobile games, because they are always garbage (except temple run). but this game is great. it's simple, casual fun. it controls well, it runs smoothly, and the art style is wonderful. the only negative reviews here are about the ads. which is how the devs get paid. if ads bother you, you can pay $3.50 do get rid of them, or just turn your wifi and data off. quit review bombing because you're too cheap too support the developers. they made a great game.
nintendo4dudes : one of my favorite games i have ever played on my phone! the grafics, the gameplay its just so amazing! i really suggest that you get this game. but it would be nice of tou could add designs to your car like flames or maybe paint splat or what ever you guys at 111% think would bee best to add. but keep up the food work and keep those updates coming.
dwaipayan vidyanta : my experience with the app was wonderful. although i would love to see the transition between day and night and also weather changes. hope you guys would make a racing game with similar graphics
teo stavridis : simply the best mobile driving game. a variety of cars you can use by collecting caps, so reminiscent of when i was a kid and collected caps. from design to physics 5/5! plus i loved the detail of the tilting menu.
gl1tch : who's behind this game ? i'm amazed... this is phenomenal! the art style is crazy, the ui is really good, the phone movement affecting the ui is over the top! wow... i genuinely wanna know who's behind the game and how it was created, i wanna learn coding and make a game in the future and wow this upped my standards for a mobile game, please, is there any way to see what's behind the scenes ? thank you for creating such an amazing game.
szymon gorgon : it is a really simple game but it manages to pull you into it because of how fun it it. i have never seen a game so simple yet so creative. i recommend this game to people who like driving games with a bit of challenge. the devs of this game are one in thier kind (amazing).
josh smith : i think this is a hidden gem in progress. i've been playing for a while and have unlocked a few cars.. it needs more content like a drift mode or something you can earn more caps with. and what the other guy said add some motorbikes... could make a wicked game. keep up the good work
a google user : absolutely stunning really enjoyable and one of it's kind. the gameplay is dope and visually very satisfying to look at still could use a little tweaking here and there but apart from that i'd say it's a must play title!
somesh : the perfect game , most apt for the size . graphics are next level , with smooth gameplay , even for crude phones . the controls are damn , with nice themes and some motion sensors to give a finishing touch . a must have app for lads who love arcade racing ( ppl who like fast paced action racing can choose asphalt or need for speed ) . overall , this is one of my , ...... if not , the best racing game i have on my device . pixel perfect dude has achieved what many companies dream to .
dane sorensen : i've really enjoyed this game. my goal was to get a hover conversion delorean (hoverion?), but now i have it, it's terribly bugged. it behaves fine in the learner park, but on tracks, it will fail to steer after a drift. railroading you into obstacles.
disint - official : love playing this and listening to some 808. keep adding cars and maps and stuff! i only just got it and i have a ton of stuff to unlock, but the more the better! maybe we can have an option to add stickers and stuff to cars manually at some point!
thanos kitsakis : one of the best mobile racing games there is! beautiful graphics, satisfying gameplay, an overall great experience. i wish the paid version was a bit cheaper, though.
sadra rezaee : hands down one of the best mobile games out there. artstyle is unique and beautiful, lots of locations and cars to travel to/with, and just so much fun and satisfying to drift through the beautiful environments the devs have created!
gerald lepage : great arcade driving game with retro-ish flat poly shaded style. easy to collect coins, not overly annoying obstacles, and a good amount of humor laced in makes this one of the better mobile games i've played recently. donate to the devs if you can, they did a great job on this game.
kevin d : a lot of variety integrated into the gameplay. on the next version i would add a view like most racers use, just above the car-just behind it. i would reduce drift reqs because it gets tedious.
dave kasuma : it was a simple game but was very entertaining, i really enjoyed it. the developers are also very active updating the game and adding new maps. it was very addicting. played it for hours and hours losing track of time. very fun recommend it.
craig olson : the game has a few quirks, but are easy to overcome. i wish that there was a way to better understand some of the mechanics. for example, i had no idea you could customize a vehicle. but aside from these quirks, the game is fun and addicting and i can't get enough of it!
yavor rashev : man this became an instant classic for me the moment i started playing. the developers relly put their hearts into this one. love the vibes and the engine. even brought back childhood memories as some of the old cars can sometimes be spotted around my city today and we used to own the "wego" from the game back in the 90s.
john doe : simple but time consuming game. graphics and cars are unique and well done. possibly add new bonus features like funky graphics and add ons for cars, and a few more tunes to the game. thanks!
6-thu hao : good game bc is like high quality and some stuff
rip this account : the visuals are beautiful. controls are interesting but aren't difficult at all. it sucks that you get a game over after bumping into a fence or the back of the car, though. all in all, this game is fantastic.
alexander russell : really good game, both entertaining and good to look at. i absolutely love the cars chosen, as they're not the obvious same-old classic exotics but more common cars that most people can remember. top-notch game.
avery spencer : i played when it very first came out and hated it. now, frickin great. if you find the steering hard pause it and adjust the sensitivity to your liking. i even paid to remove ads i enjoy it so much now.
rob bob : pretty fun and great game to pass time *pro tip adjust the sensitivity down when u first start playing unless ur good with it. spent a couple bucks for some coins right off the bat! bought what looks like the mustang and a map. not bad fella's, pls bring more maps to drive in the future
proud infidel : basic game that has sweet cell shading graphics. not into the run type games but i do enjoy this game especially when you can do a little drifting and watch that dust fly. simple controls. not much to it but making sure you don't get too crazy in traffic. great time killer.
daniel bogeholz : quite fun and very enjoyable. earning any of the currencies such as postcards to get more levels is quite grindy and somewhat difficult but besides that its a very solid game. graphics are incredibly good and surprise me every time i fire up this game, massive thumbs up for that. controls are amazingly fluid and easy to use making this game such a pleasure to play.
fam solorzano : very fun game. easy to just play a few minutes at a time. only time you have ads is when you want to revive after a crash or get bonus coins after youre done. you xan actually play without ever seeing an ad!!!
mr rjb : this game is just phenomenal, the graphics are awesome for a mobile game, and the gameplay is really smooth, i'm playing on a low-end phone and it's still running at a smooth 60fps. the controls are a little hard but they're easy to get used to.
jf designers : greatest endless runner i've ever played, great graphics, runs smoothly, response controls, challenging gameplay and greatest of all, no p2w features, every singels car, map etc, in the game is unloackable bh playing the,rewarding you for skil, no for how much you spwnt on it. also great music and voice acting.
tomek styn : it's art style is very unique. i like the overall experience. it's responsive but drifting may be a little counter-intuitive... no way to counter-steer during a drift.
shibacki : this game is phenomenal. so much effort with maybe 1 ad (that's skippable) every 5-10 minutes. there's so much effort, and everything works so well, and the art is so pretty. it's just amazing. easily top 3 mobile games. this game really gives me a new hope for mobile games.
eriel plazo : it's good for an game, the graphics, the controls and the designs are also good. however, there's no tutorial about the buffs you can obtain so i have no idea on what buff i'm obtaining
asap_alex3 punay : this game is class and most of the time keeping things simple shows how good a game can be and this is a perfect example: has nice controls, graphics are good and what i could say to improve is maybe due to the type of terrain is maybe change the grip of the vehicle.
riley brannan : very smooth and simple, but incredibly addicting and fun! i've really enjoyed it so far. the only thing i'd like to see would maybe be some way to chase other players as the cop and try to spin them out before they reach a certain distance
jason : enjoyable game. simple concept, executed well. controls are easy to pick up, and the art style is charming. ads are removable for a reasonable price. bravo.
wayne smail : beautifully simple, mindlessly enjoyable. a definite must-have on your phone. the controls are great, it's super addictive, and has a fantastic range of cars to collect.
shawn dackonish : very few advertisements to deal with. a variety of simple vehicles to attain. the environments are different and fun to experience. simple mechanics, except drifting is tricky.
fletch hasues : well produced game that is a good single player time passer. the screen controls are what make the game difficult. a large variety of vehicles to use that mimic automobiles of old.
fhs : great game. i know others have said they'd want a tutorial, but i disagree - i don't mind experimenting. gameplay is challenging, but fun, and ads are reasonable and non-intrusive.
jack gulledge : it's been good so far so i like it *edit* i've thought about the steering and i thought it would be cool to add the steering where the car turns with the device so i would love for the developers to think about this in a future update thank you and please take this into some major consideration
adil khadir : good game, lots of cars, fun levels. could use more levels though. also needs a countdown to resume after pausing the game. graphics are great but the draw distance in some levels is distractingly short.
ken m : found your game on twitter on the first day of release! i love it! even though i actually never play any car/racing games at all. already unlocked all maps and all cars i wanted, so waiting for more content, while enjoying the game. oh, also happy with a new price, instantly removed ads :)
darsh thakkar : very good game. there's a lot of cars and i like the new multiplayer update and upgrade car feature . the new event car is very cool must try this game . i have been playing this game since 2019 .tip:- high grip cars are best for covering long distances . must try .
mihir gupta : right now there's a bug, of you go simply "next , next next" everything works fine but if you go " back" from location screen to vehicle screen it gets stuck there i.e it won't further go next or back again. have to close and restart the app. please look into it. much love
kye i love big batteryzzz : nice, just nice. i do have one complaint, but its not the devs fault. i use a galaxy and have the hard press home button feature on, so whenever i get too excited i acidentaly go home and crass into a wall lol. but its a solid game. 9/10would recomend. wish they added more ways to customize cars visualy!
champions gaming : best game but i would like if we could customise cars by adding bumpers , tires, flags , silensers , spoilers, etc (2) i would like strips of tires on sandy roads , snow etc (3) in my mobile i could easily take pictures of car and the scenery but in my friend mobile it just shows grey and there is nothing otherwise the 3d baground and the physics are dang asowme best unlimited fun game i was looking for these type of games and i found it highly recommend game
will ratcliff : awesome! for a racing app, it's pretty fun. not much in the way of bugs, and adds aren't too obtrusive. seems pretty balanced and very expensive car lists. i like it!
asher girton : best mobile game i've played in a long time. ads are also not bogging up anything. you're able to play with absolutely no ads bothering and you can choose to watch them to revive, get extra currency, and support the developers
maddox king : great game to pass time. it isn't overly complicated so you don't need to get engrossed into the game to do well. it feels very nice and fluent to play. it is very rewarding to get new cars and maps. highly recommend to people who like cars and car physics.
deepesh gupta : i really love the graphics. just polish the car a bit in the environment. because it's odd to see a plan player car in la mirabelle and other cars reflecting the yellow fog. i will give it 5 stars coz it diservers it.
mohammad amin hamednia : nice game... but keep working on it,it can be better too much! bring some other modes like a little open map to drag or race with other cars,let cups car to follow some racers during the drive(when we aee the cup),make it online,and bring some tuning kits(like smoke,or backe fire...) thanks a lot
sebastian r. stadler : so far it's amazingly fun to play! controls not like a real racing game but more arcade style but i love the graphics and the names for the cars. good game to pass some time.
iyinoluwa akinsuyi : absolutely love this game. it's the perfect game for me to pass time and still enjoy it. i love all the attentyto detail and most especially the photo mode... i'd definitely recommend it even if you're not a car person.
summerizemlee noobest : a very fun driving game. awesome looking art style, and it got some really cool background music too. also, the voice lines made the ride a bit more fun. this game is a really funky game for smartphones.
han solo : everything feels so well polished, it's quiet an impressive achievement. only the 5 seconds loop samples of "music" are terrible (excellent sound really, but soooooo short tiny little).
trey carpenter : coins/caps need to be worth much more. there are so many cars to unlock and they take forever to even get cheap ones. other than that it's a good looking time killer!
corey ince : addictively fun. the graphics are cool and artistic. the learning curve is low making it easy to get into and the difficulty ramps at a decent pace. enjoy playing it so far.
leni _ : really enjoyable, one of the best experiences i got from mobile games. getting new cars isn't time consuming and it's not too easy to earn either. the vehicles themselves are very different from each other and maps are quite detailed
the rel h : i like the style and the mechanics really well made
cold campfire : a quality game by dovelopers who care it's fun with loads of 80s cars and good controls its also realy fun with the drifting but to be honest the brakes just don't work i almost never use them most of the time instead of saving you they will just make you crash but apart from that its amazing
kriss kross : nice game it's so good because it is an endless game i recommend add some drivers that you could use while driving.
anthony aiello : steering controls feel as if the amount you turn suddenly increases after half a second of holding the button. could use some tweaking, but overall it's a pretty good game.
jacob oberg : fun, simple game. no bs, it teaches you how to play and let you have at it. fast pace, you can play over and over. go to settings and look for the drift set up, drifting is useful for getting round and adds a score multiplier. get a lot of duke boys vibes from this game. maybe add some jumps.
aaron foster : it's an endless runner (driver i guess) with a lot of variety in both levels and cars. quite easy to get into but also tricky to master as things start to speed up.
zeorynex : the game is really fun and challenging in longer runs, would be nice if u could optimize the handling and controls i find it wonky sometimes. also add more vehicles & features in the future update.
ryland novak : amazing. i absolutely love this game and the design concept behind it. the maps are fun to drive on and the cars all are pretty cool. its fun to see how far you can get and how many caps you can collect!
estevao andre : i loved everything in this game! its graphics and old times theme are amazing. the gameplay is very arcade, but it's reasonable. keep doing the great job you do devs... you have a masterpiece in your hands :)
tdog adkins : great game. i love to drive around endlesley, and the cars and upgrades arent over priced to really fun!
endersbane : honestly in my opinion it is the best arcade driving game in the store. it has fun gameplay and amazing pixel art for the car. i really hope the developers continue to improve and make their games.
sledho : its pretty decent game, i like the new interface for the car selection and main menu. it gives a nice vibe. the game itself is a bit wonky but you get used to it. overall a good game
benchi : love the game, just am hoping you guys will move towards optional ads rather than forced ads. forced ads have kind of become an instantaneous no-go for me but this game is special. i won't pay for an ad-free experience but i still love the game!
louie tune : it's very easy to play and real graphics and very nice to see the full version download the free version and the best thing to work with a few words of wisdom teeth removed from work and effort to make a difference between what you were a lot to me with a white background and the other was a little while ago but it is not an intended
surakshith sarathi : best game to play during quarantine days. just makes me mad when i realize that the controls are so sensitive, but that's a great challenge for gamers, particularly driving simulator lovers, i hope so.
forsho : there are a lot of endless driving games but this one, this one is different. a really good offline game to play. good graphics, good gameplay, good cars, what else u want from a good game :)
mojito : good game. i dont like the new braking limit though. it also kept prompting me to rate the game which is why im here. i like that they added the unlock all cars and tracks which they didnt have with the previous version
quintus u-wei : pretty great game. some of the car names are funny. the game is fun overall and nothing is locked behind a paywall(thank goodness). didn't notice any bugs(other than the cars of course. pun unintended).
102 dhruv sirsaikar : this game is awesome!!!!! the graphics are really good. the gameplay is kind of soothing. and i actually love that some achievements are secret. the cars are also really good. overall, this is one of the best car games. i just can't stop playing it!!!!
hypenzoo : i really love this game because there are so many cars to unlock. the controls are also very easy to learn
toonixon14 : honestly a great arcade game in the endless driving genre, gameplay is engaging and fun enough to keep playing, graphics look great and i love the low poly aesthetic. very fun game with a lot of heart and soul put into making it.
samim akter : everything is ok just you need to more optimize
diycyberpunk : free version ads aren't overwhelming like other games. good game progression, pretty forgiving hotboxes, and not too bad on battery life. the grind makes sense and is worth it, keeps me coming back for more.
aiman el_ghoul : the game is fun, but i have a small problem. i want to add a category of owned cars because i take time to find the car i want to play with.
l : lots of fun and pcisk you wanting to play more and unlock all the vehicles...... so ..... many..... vehicles
branescu alex : it's a cool game but it would be nice if u update more often the game.u can add more maps like france, italy and more cars.as the game, it s easy to play and have nice graphics. i hope u will update this game and add more features.
keith david : this game is one the most fun time killers i've played yet, but i would like to say that adding in a button where the car you drive would be selected randomly would be great for those looking to spice things up.
happynespresso : excelent! the animations are glorious and carefully made. the gameplay is completely enjoyable. the content is filled up till the head, there are so many options. completely perfect on every sense.
my_true_identity : litterarly the best game on the appstore, it competes with console and pc games, that isn't even exagerated. i'd give more stars if i could, every little detail in this game, from funny commentary to cool cars to simple/fun gameplay completes this game.
vargo paradise : addicted game pls add more cars to improve your game,but the graphic is good also my english is suck lol thanks anyways for the rate
hydrolistic : it's really good and fun car driving and it doesn't force ads down your gamer throat. but you do have the option to use ads to make even faster progress.
patrick marquette : challenging but easy to learn. lots of cars and tracks to drive on. i paid for no ads which greatly increases the enjoyment and availability to play without annoying ads!
hunter henry : it's good other than it being teties of when it asks for a revive but good
jetro james panday : i love the graphics and effects. the controls are easy. i looking forward for more games with graphics like this please in the future with rpg genre.
moon moni : really good game. great smooth control. very good graphics and artstyle. low ad. i like that u can skip some fuel stations. overall awesome...i wouldnt change anything abt this game...
oleksandr pohrebniak : one of the best mobile games. visuals and audio are beautiful, gameplay is simple yet challenging, tons of cars, a plentiful of locations. amazing soundtrack on german and japanese locations.
indarkment : its one of the best games i have played tons of cars from diffrent sections to choose from maps are well made and each map has something new in it a good currency system easy controls and you can even upgrade your cars plus the coolness thing is awsome
mohit mohan mishra : i like the narration part, this game is so smooth with minimalistic requirements. absolutely beautiful game with beautiful controls. to be honest this is my top tier favourite game that exist on mobile platform. and with the new console feature it's just became more great.
daniel myles : the controles are cool i love how the trackions under the tiers change what makes it interesting is how small the power up zones are (wonder if a pan cam would spice things up ...a nice zoom in and pan to the side on the car when passing another vehical or maybe a close shot when close to the walls but that would take some calculating for the sake of over all entertainment to be sustained with an alteration maybe another graphics enging with pan algorythems
arindam roy : the developer really gave attention to the overall experience with this game, the home screen, the menu, car galleries all look so aesthetically pleasing. not to mention actual game graphics are splendid too
aamir khan : handling at first is very hard but if you spend some time on it , you can easily control the vehicle . the graphics and music gets a standing ovation . good luck developers with your future project.
bueas ink95 : amazing! hooked on this game. the visuals, interface controls the wide variety of cars to choose from and they even have the legendary (ok maybe not so legendary) ae85! cheers to the devs for real. i rarely dish out five stars but i love this game.
christopher alvord : one of the best games i have ever played, definitely one of my favorites. it works better on some devices compared to others but still a great game. i would rcommend it to anyone. i love the graphic style and the gameplay. i appreciate the work you put into this game and hope that you guys add more to it and that more people play it as well.
yasmin nurlatifah hidayati : the graphics is very nice. i have a slighty slow reflex hand motions which made me easily bump in something and it really test my patience... but overall this is a good game!! thank you for the hard works.
matt luxton : really fun game. smooth colourful graphics. simple controls but challenging and addictive gameplay. love the various vehicles and the caricature style of them. recommended if you like your endless games or cars.
manu madhav : very impressive game i wish that you could add a few more cars and locations to make it interesting. otherwise, it has an impressive gameplay, great locations, good background music and nice cartoony graphics.
squeakn george : i thought this game was amazing the graphics a pretty good and it is so easy to collect cars all you have to do is complete tasks and there you go you have a car. i would highly recommend this game for any who are interested.
fajri andari : good graphic and simple
parth ry : love the zen gameplay... the game is beautiful... the devloper's efforts are well shown... won't ruin the rating just to get dev's attention, but i'd really love to have more maps... the unlock system of the game is perfect with no need to spend actual money or grind mindlessly... thanks for the beautiful game
royal fox : the movie thing, eh i like it, not nessasary though.. it's a driving game, now what i did not like is the fact i can't make a u-turn. like when we hit the gass station or repair shop. i tried, but then it just like won't turn anymore, i understand why... i'm not supposed to do that. either way rly fun
y33t bruv : i really enjoy playing this game. the 70's cop chase, hit the road sort of concept, i find, is really cool. i never get bored of playing. although, one suggestion. i have postcards piling up and i would like to maybe see a new map, but overall a great game. keep up the good work.
zavaron : add more maps and something else except that straight street all the to your crash. maybe you could make different ways which will lead you through the maps you have. nice game. already have all the maps and a 100 extra postcards.
thatguyjacobee : amazing game with great graphics and effects, very good hud/gui around the app and great compatibility with s10+. updates are quick and very good and a wide range of cars are available. easy 5 stars one of the most played games on mobile.
adithya : unique masterpiece. great work by developers. graphics, controls, gameplay everything is amazing. please add multiplayer in which vechiles can dash. i think it will be one of the best game.
rens kwakkenbos : pretty good, can really see the hard work put in to this
lapura the snep : this is a pretty fun game. when i just want something to do i can "drive" for a while and enjoy the art style. the challenges make it so you have something to do while you drive to keep it interesting. so try it maybe
jo heck : a great game, fun to play with almost no microtransactions. the ones that exist are lifetime purchases. all in all, if you're looking for a game that's easy to pick up and easy to put down again, look no further.
cam cam : this game is fun, no glitches it alright! i play this everyday when i installed this keep up the good work.
xx mrspudguns xx : this game is a great time waster, the graphics are nice and clean, the controls are responsive and easy to use and there is a huge selection of fine classical vehicles for you to try. so fun.
troit : the game is good, it looks and plays amazing. after playing for a few days it dint get boring like most mobile games. there are so many collectable cars, that it will take a while to unlock. 10/10
pure agression : this is definitely a cherry game. what i mean by that is this is the kind of thing you find after searching for months. definitely somthing i look forward to progressing in. i recommend anybody who has the money to buy the no ads cause with them your experience will be ruined.
adidas slav : the cartoony graphics are very well designed, the songs are wonderfully made, and the controls with mechanics are easy and fast to understand. oh, plus the weekly updates where there is a new vehicle and bug with glitch fixes.
andrew jonathan : i love this game. but this game need 1 improvement. please let the player check the objective while playing. i mean let the player see the objective when the player click the pause button. that will make the player finish the objective faster.
amurillo reno : suggestion. could you guys possibly add daily missions/rewards? grinding the cap back then was okay since we didn't have to worry about upgrading our vehicle stats, but now that it exists, grinding bottle caps could take time longer than it should. i hope you may consider daily missions/rewards. thank you!
mahan siamian : love your game... but need more things such as a zen mode with no traffic, fuel limit, cops, etc... so we can enjoy drifting... also make that coolness upgrade useful... for example when you upgrade it, your car looks more badazz
ohmtrix : very nice game entertaining, loads of cars amazing, just one thing. when i play with the police car for example 'the cherry top' can you make a feature where you have the choice to flash em up and make it wail please? that would be amazing and i would be most grateful!
jack martin : cool enjoyable game. the gameplay is simple but challenging, the selection of vehicles is good and the visuals (so far) are are good too.
alyx g raff : really fun casual driving game. the simplistic gameplay hides challenging turns especially when trying to pickup powerups without crashing. definetly check this out if your a fan of casual racing games.
trevon mckinley : amazing. really fun and cartoons. the physics are great. ot takes a little getting used to but it will just click. my new fav game. (classic muscle cars please) more free roam would be awesome too. i love you guys.
ajinkya pande : a very simple game with nice graphics, high difficulty and lots of cars to drive through the old cities. thats why it's editor's choice game. love it.
emmanuel ukoni : it's really cool... with the reset option.. totally exceptional
john becker : little hard to drive, but gets fun once you get it
wessel driessen : fun and fair. game provides lots of cars and an increasingly complicated learning curve. amount of in-game money earned is very fair, and even microtransactions provide you with a lot of value for money (this is literally the only game i've ever played in which it sounded like a good deal to me)
tito cruz : it's worth the 2.99 to get the add free version. did not disappoint.
aleksandar zigrai : 10/10 game i love it first game on phone that i actually like
rou lis : amazing graphics with funny commentary. all around this game has a lot of character and a wide selection of cars and sceneries to pick. super relaxing and fun too!
wong jimmy : a very interesting game to pass the time. my only suggestion is that developer should make it easier for players to choose their vehicle of choice in this game. something like filtering search would be sufficient
some buddy : wicked fun game with a cute art style that screams fun. this game is what you would expect car driving with little realism to be. this game gives you a new kind of fun. the game is simple but becomes a challenge
bill whitlock : i love this game! it's not an easy game, all cars feel different, challenging might be a bit of an understatement, but.... i like games that make me practice to be good. great game for anyone who wants to go fast, run from police, open highway pass and drifts, etc....
sanchit vaidya : such a nice game with poly style graphic with no lags it's awesome and fun to drive lots of different cars and it's addictive but you can add more stuff like power ups which we get on road while driving and add contract like stealing car , escaping the robber's gang from police and much more to make the game more awesome and addictive
devon wood : this game is a beautiful combination of unique controls, attractive graphics, and fun concept. i look forward to seeing further updates.
ibraheem hoseen : i love this game but please have different options so u could play as a plane or boat too i hope your game becomes the best
sai surya nattuva : pretty fun to play with simple controls and no annoying ads. decent graphics and cute little cars. love the narration that goes on in the background!
pubg montages : i liked this game very much as it is great time killer it dont matter if it is animated but its amazing once in a blue moon a car will come out of nowhere looking completely lost then the subtitles starts the co driver stsrts speaking about his experience and then the car crashes the game is over well great controls great graphics awesome game i had a great experience in playing this game so i give a bunch of thanks to the creators thank you thanks pixel perfect dude
g r : very fun game to play on the go, although i do wish they would explain how to drift somewhere. otherwise the controls are good and i love the visual design.
vpul1605 : definitely this is worth giving a shot....a beautiful game.... it's really addicting...loved it... guys ... trust me developers had done amazing work.. slight changes on how each city looks from each other would be awesome....but nevermind!!
abu muhammad jubair : an awesome game. offline. lots of cars. cool graphics. cops. cartoonish look. easy to score and store. challanging but simple controls. cars dont crash unless you hit something head on. very fun game.
reymundo barrera : it is an amazingly fun game. i really enjoy playing it because it is a very straightforward experience and gameplay. the mechanics are excellent as well as the graphics. it is an extremely polished game and the attention to detail is pretty good. very recommendable.
adrian ojog : properly done game! can't wait for new locations and cars! would love to see some more development, like more choices for a turn or an explore mode (something like a city, with blocks and buildings.)
khalid salman : this was really a great game under this amount of game size, i really like the animation, voiceover, and them as well . keep it up , and you should give a try yourself if you're finding a game under 200mb .
shreddy 03 : its a great and cool game there are many car options and many map options to but i would love it even more if you guys add more maps more speed cars and a wheel control setting overall its a great game if you want to drive endlessly.
rishabh gusain : the game is literally fabulous, this game has everything whatever i can expect from it!!! and even more things. i would just like to give developer to give a suggestion to add option to change the controls!
qwerty : this is the best drift race game i've ever seen, it has maps that takes place all over the world, great cars, and easy controls! it's the best and i suggest you play it!
brian jackson : its a really good game and all its just that i wish that you could modify your car like if you change the rims but also i wish that there was a mode where you could do races against npcs and other players and i also wish that when you drift that you could pull the handbrake
david busev : pretty fun game. not too many ads so it's playable, thats more than i can say about some other games. alot of content as well, and a decent challenge. thanks devs!
xonion-chanx : graphics are not bad. i like it when there are so much to see. plus the 3d screen in the garage really looks decent. i love playing these types of games! keep up the good work!
a s t h e t i c a l y p l e a s i n g : an amazing game for racing fans. controls arent hard at all, you just need to learn how to steer. graphics is just as amazing..... highly recommend this game for racing fans. ads arnt a prblem if you disconnect the wifi.
okay okay : very well optimized game. real time motion in background without any lagness. various types of vehicles to unlock and to upgrade them by collecting caps by playing the game. very nice animation .
weylin renison : fun and beautiful time waster with enough motivation to keep playing to discover new maps and purchase other cars. the breaking mechanic is a bit strange and difficult to use.
peter gunther : great game, it even loads on a samsung j3 no lag. play it anywhere, unlock new things. i love it!
gentry meer : this is a wow for me. at first i don't like to play it because i am scared to try new ones, but as i play it, man this is the best. this is also a hilarious game because of how you not be wanted on the cop just collect donuts haha, and also an enjoyable game and also most addictive game in my phone. please for the improvement of the game add more and lots of cars but also try to add some motors in the next update, can you do it? i know you can. thank you very much for the game.
don diwauripo thefirst : just started playing the game. loving it. especially the no ads as yet part
tom noneofyourbusiness : good game. extremely favourable amount of ads. really nicely designed. good level progression. quite addictive. please give me an option to turn off that annoying voice.
paul moore : pretty solid distraction every once in a while. kind of feel like an old arcade game in a very good way, and it's not bloated with microtransactions like everything else around here.
kenneth thompson : great game the graphics are nice
vitor goncalves : pretty chill game but entertaining. the steering buttons on the left are too close to the edge, my thumb keeps falling outside of them :/ there's potential in the car upgrades
ruvan geo : i love it but it is to hard
toe tet aung : it's a really good game i play every day for fun
geraldo harold : perrrfect! the game works well, and it's so much enjoyable graphic is great, i love the simplistic style, the control is good, just need a little practice, and there is the zen mode! to drive in more peaceful road...
dody alkarim : the game is actually a fun and simple time wasting when you just need a quick getaway. the microtransaction in this game is not even that expensive, and even the most expensive car doesn't cost that much irl money
brandon flisram : very fun game. many different vehicles to choose from and challenges to complete. great game to kill time with. would love to see an 18 wheeler added!!
d s : the gameplay is good graphics are also beautiful but controls are a bit hard. but overall this game is good. my suggestion is to make this a multiplayer racing game.
clever mind jr : awesome work. the graphics , the audio are great. this is like a fun and adventure game. if it's possible i would have been given 10 stars. can you add multiplayer mode? as we can race with friends.
nick franco : it is amazing but i feel like there could be a little more diversity on the levels but besides that it is a great game and you just turn off your wifi or airplane mode so no ads
alexis ortega : i thought it was going to be a boring game... but i was clearly wrong! it's amazing with great graphics and i love the narrators voice and how he makes it feel like ur the one driving and he's on the passenger seat. ( )
gesse olausen : i played this a couple years ago, i enjoy the wide variety of vehicles.(even though i'm not very good at unlocking them) the controls are simple and the driving physics are superb!
rexo : polished, simple, well made. overall perfect, maybe just some bug fixes. and the great part is, it can be played anywhere and anytime.
paul lanxade : very fun, i like how this game is made. i like arcade games, this one is a very good one. you should at least try it.
cfnr railfan : i really do love the game, not to many adds, my most favorite car! though 1 thing i do want to be fixed is the coolness for the 59' slimey all i ask to change on it is the emergency lights change from red to blue and the ghost busters logo is actually noticeable rather than just small incorrect symbols.
jake in the cloud : is super addictive, the retro image is cool and the gameplay is intuitive and easy but as you advance becomes more hard. in brief it's very cool.
mk achu : aswsome graphics, maps,
alex fields : well balanced gameplay. beautifull graphics. optimistic narrative as cherry on top. game goes with arcade handling. i play it from time to time and keep in my apps list

shoeb chouhan : after the update of the game it become more interesting and more challenging. more cars and levels makes the game perfect. best game everyone should play atleast once and they will get addicted.
lucasperson : i have been playing this game for a long time, and i have to say, it's my favourite game on my phone. this game is simple but quite addicting and unique. this is a first for me personally to find a game that had the qualities a game should have. it's nothing like the new voodoo games, there aren't many ads in this game, and they don't ask for your information. the main story is something i have never seen before, and puts a twist on driving and racing games.
sebastian pettit : i absolutely loved this game before the update with the white boxes and all. i changed devices but was signed into google play before switching but now that im using my new device all my progress is gone except for my best distances for each location. please revert back to the old vehicle selection interface.
vimukthi ediriweera : amazing graphics, gameplay is excellent too. if you can add motion controls to steer the car, this game would be perfect.

perodua kancil : this update was better and perfect then before....cars and places also improve the combination between american muscle and jdm is very beatiful...i love it very much....the zen mode are the infinity driving...i love the photo mode this was i looking for and its can capture the beautiful moment....this is the perfect apps in playstore i have been download before
asyraf tojiman : theres a bug. the graphics and the actual occurences is not align. i kept hitting the "invicible" car eventho the graphic shows the cars is still far in front.
shubham singh : i like this endless runner with retro style and limit less vehicles to choose from. but what i didn't like was the level missions are repetitive and way too grindy.
abdulrahman alsaleh : i wasn't expecting that much fun from a game like this but i think i was wrong its good fun well made game easily can be one of the best games in the store 5/5 there only something is i dont see the different when i upgrade the vehicle or when i changed it like they all the same with a small change
jarred japtha : this game is awesome when you online and playing it lags but is quite simple also for an update the developers could add an endless mode so that you can drive through all the countries and you could earn some good money.
ib aj ya : good game, the gameplay and control are easy to get used to, its simple yet addictive game.. but can you please add more maps so it wont be boring, and it would be good if you have some kind of story or maybe campaign mode..

andu planken : very fun game good graphics
qutbuddin pardawala : a very unique game implementation from the navigation perspective. the free board navigation and the 3d depth effect work great and gameplay remains simple yet fun. the background score and comments are hilarious too. kudos
mayuresh sonawane : i love how the controls and physx are put together.....the only drawback i can see is the ui / in game color optimization is little bit on dull side...(hard to read fuel and donut signs..it can be better)
patric burns : great game. very simple, easy to understand game play thats quick fun. but the unlock system makes the game just addicting enough to where you keep coming back.
maxmax : the steering takes time ti get used to but it's pretty good, i just wish that there was an option to turn off motion blur on the high graphics setting.

brad paul : first time trying this and im already on love lol. its a rlly nice game, just wish they could add tilt so i could move around better

tauhid amin : very good game. all is like real. thanks
censor : this game plays fluidly, controls never felt too stiff or loose and i like how car models have dynamic handling and different strengths and weaknesses to balance the game out but not as much as the lack of intrusive ads rate this an initial d tofu mobile/10

dracyan25 : the grafics are amazing and the cars are sweet, just adjust the controllers a bit each time i press down for a certain time and let go it keeps going and spins around which is ending my streak and i dont like that but anyway the game is fun

jordan sobrino : endless driving games have been done to death, but there's something about the arcadey car controls and highly stylized visuals that have really made me love playing this.
yeswanth kasarapu : it's a fantastic game and the graphics are minimal once you start playing you get addicted to the game kudos to the developers for developing such a game try to develop a bike mode & motion controls in #drive from india.

emir mcmxciii : try to understand this game, this game is not about racing and speed car chases, this is about an atmospheric and relaxing ride through beautiful environments just to make you feel good, this games is a driving version of alto's adventure.
james asis : the graphics are good and it's easy to play. gg
abdullah abazeed : very nice and eazy game and its so funny i like it
sp3ctrum 1212 : i love this game its so fun at beautiful but i wish there were more power ups or maybe the ability to upgrade them e.g last longer....also i would love for you to add more game modes like races or stunts maybe as it does get boring after a bit so please add.....apart from that great game thanks
mark ireson : fixed game crash issue. back to awesome fun. new menus okay after getting used to it. not sure how to achieve the drift thing though.
dragomir mircea-robert : when i started playing, the game had like one car. now there's a load of categories and tracks and upgrades! and nice visuals and sound! fun fun fun!!

lemonaresweet - : one of the few games i've ever rated 5 stars. there are some ads since i a mobile game, but they hlgive you the option to get rid of them with a 1 time payment. the ads tho aren't much of a problem.
ryo niko : it was a fun and classic! i like where you can even access the place and the vehicle in inital d, and other sorts of places relevant to tv shows. all in all it was fun! perfect for enjoying non ending games.
milifkun : the game is already perfect for its genre, but i have some suggestions especially the commentary guy, i think it will feel more immersive if the commentary guy language is matching the city you play. and adding some city would be good too
allen thomas : i love the animations, the graphics is so high res. the design is very fluid. and the game is very entertaining. i love the ingame comentary.
leonardo a.anjos : i barely write reviews but this game deserves one. drifting system, graphics, challenges, diversity of cars, every single aspect of this game is perfect.
shivanshu sharma : great game. i have unlocked every location in a matter of days. soundtrack of "vinh vang" is truly awesome. missions are there but one particular one, "trick the police" is not getting done.
polaris123 impossible : pretty nice for a mobile game tbh, i would give the idea like splitting roads that we can choose, or like some special event or something, just my ideas but it's a pretty good game to play if your looking for more casual stuff.
deepali rai : nice game the game has nice graphics but please add india please
justin's gaming channel : great very time consuming and very low ads
saleha shuja : i love it its great and just the game that is fun or so etching idk its cool.

matt shipley : old school driving game at its best. excellent.
vincent ford : this is a great game. the graphics are amazing hardly any ads and the ads are all short and if you click accidentally it doesnt send you to the app store
varun jeesukh : well this game has it all by we cn ask from a proper free runner. easy to control but he'd to master. easily one of the bet open endless drivers out here on playstore. upgrading your car might need some coins or god control over your drive.
laurence keir : loads of fun, great style and music
davit nergadze : if anything just only the devs effort deserves for everyone to give this game 5 stars! thank you and please, keep up the good work! i play the game rarely recently but i've never though of removing it just because i want best quality apps on my device! p.s.: gyroscope control mode would be great addition.
matthew demitor : very fun and very intense. the zen mode is fun and the police chases are really cool because you speed up and then it makes everything harder to get. definitely recommend.
chantel & brandon bernal : it's been 2 years and i still have heart in this game
bad dog mike : it has been a good game so far i have been playing this since last around this time. to the developers can you please add russia as a location and make parts of it look like soviet era buildings and the rest with old houses and field's? thanks for making this game.
chick bungus : great game, nothing else to say, good mediation in ads, not too many to make me want to die, not too less to make me feel sorry for you, good game quality, nice voice acting, good pacing, and it overall feels like a game that could cost money, but doesn't
salman iza : fun, easy to learn/hard to master game that will have you spending hours trynna make it that much farther than you did before. easy recommendation for anyone looking for something different in the 'endless runner' genre.
pierson laverdiere : wow, this game, incredible. i'm giving this game a 5 star review because of it's fun gameplay, the car selection, and the variety of maps, and most of all the fact that there are barely any ads
nico ballesteros : game is pretty neat with all the current maps and cars. hope that in the future they add specific tuning to the car (i.e. wheels, decals). also add more maps to be played
alex bolt : good game, just controls are a bit fiddly. to control the car you need to have your fingers on the screen which blocks some of the hud.
tr1gonometry : awesome! i only have gotten 2 adds so far
bosnianboy : the game is really great i love it so much. tho i have a suggestion maybe you guys could add more maps like a russian or middle eastern map, i think that would be great. it doesnt have to be any of that but those are just suggestions.
jiaqir : very nice game! i love the driving experience.
porsche liebhaber : good game if you like simple driving. my only complaint is the unusual brake style as they get hot quickly and then you can't brake for about ten seconds.
shrek master : amazing game this is an amazing time killer and so many cars one thing i would like is a race multiplayer mode like a down hill run or a drag race or even a demolition derby but it is astonishing the amount of content and little to no adds but over all good game
reza .t : very good and addictive game. don't care to those who say that it's a bad game. a hint: if u don't want that the police car chase u just break in front of it, so it won't chase u any more and there isn't any need to donuts or others. tnx for makers and developers.
pog : very fun addicting game! i haven't found an entertaining game in quite some time but this is just so much fun. so many different cars to buy and pretty simple concept!
sarah : good game with nice graphics, at first the controls are pretty sensitive but after adjusting it got better. overall a great game and a fun way to pass time.
yeapps sunny : great game i tried many times to find a bug but it's cool.no bug no crash better performance on a very low end device. sound quality are also op .great gob and that's why you earned 5.0 stars
paula begay : one of my favorite mobile games that is avaliable. alot of content avaliable, from the amount of cars, maps, and challenges. great game.
sebastian miles : i would say that this is one of the best free endless runners out there. great artstyle, amazing cars, and a really nice gameplay loop.
tyler garrix : i don't generally write reviews, also this game was fairly new with less number users who have rated it, so i didn't plan of installing it. however now that i did, i'm bound to say it's one of the awesomest games out there due to it's minimalist setup. you can always know when a new game is going to be famous just by looking at it, and this one's going to be famous for sure. i recommend trying it out 100%. good work developers.
ocean natua : the graphics are perfect and the driving. but they should add tilteing steering wheel in the settings so you just need to tilt the device to turn
alireza jafarlou : this game is really fun and i love it so much and after a few years i'm playing it again thank you for making this excellent games
brent levingston : this game has the perfect difficulty. it's very fun to play and earn new cars. sometimes it feels like a grind but it's mostly a good app to get on a play for a few minutes
bereket terefe : i'm not one to rate a game... but even i think this is seriously good. could use a few more tweaks, like if the passenger guy shouting abuse knew that i had a goddamn plow on the front of my car and that's why i'm ramming everyone... but really, niggles. you guys did great. props.
david gollihar : wonderful game that doesn't push too many ads. feels great to play and has excellent controller support. unlockables aren't too hard to earn. you don't get many games like this on mobile.
volodymyr pavlov : awesome game, the gameplay is fun, cars' behavior is pleasant, visuals are a great eye candy, prem features are fair and well worth it - but by no means required. a perfect time killer!
neeket jha : wonderful game. graphics are good, car models are good, controls are rough but good. add some daily rewards. then this will become perfect
a google user : wonderful game. it's gameplay is not overwhelming as other games like this are. enjoy the japan update and the panda van. would like you make the repair shop in dusty crumbs a bit bigger to make accessible enough to enter and exit it without crashing. otherwise love the japan update.
naren dran : it's a good game has vocal exclusively and cars and places are shown nice .. although the braking is a bit difficult to get adjusted to considering i have turn into those petrol stations and donut shops .
francis ochea : i liked the game very much. i hope you can make more maps. like mostly around the world. so that we can experience an adventure traveling the whole world.
lydia lee : i love the vintage feel to this game. the controls are hard at firs but you get used to them fast. this is just the perfect game to play to pass time and just to have fun.
alhaj khaled : it is fantastic but i have a few suggestion i think whit this your game will have no competator . you have to add car brand . like bmw. benz. toyota . ford .etc many more you should add customization based on selection not option .and adding cutagories in cars customization . and more .and you have add deffrent car according to brands .
lucas magno : gameplay is cool and the graphics are awesome. almost level 10 and progress does not seem to be unreasonable.
jamel aboujrass : it's not often that you find such a quality game, and boy, i've tried a lot.
kavita : stuck at level 11 , 5 seconds consecutive drift meter doesnt increase after 3.5 seconds. edit - fixed, thank you. changed rating to 5 stars.
xeroxsennin : i like this game. its a fun little time killer, nice artwork and music. my favorites are german and japan maps, love roleplaying tofu delivery guy haha. i would like to see more maps and power ups in the future. lets say ufo power up gives you ability to fly and blast all trafic around you with lasers. postman power up gives you postcard instead of red coin after you hit all 5. maybe a dwarf power up to shrink u down. well its just silly ideas ikr, but hope to see more of this game. much love<3
l3km3rs : fun game and a great time killer. love the handling and the environments. it is easily one of the best endless runners in the play store.
b17 flying fortress : so far, the game runs smooth its easy to adapt to and its overall i good game to play on the go and the voicelines are perfect. would recommend.
dorian maralack : this game is absolutely amazing. the graphics of #drive are pretty decent for a mobile game. the game runs smoothly and the controls are good. i'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action and cars.

fluffy jello : i love it it's a game that anyone can be good at it's one of those nice mello kick back game also the music the cars the driving is smooth and when you crash you are able to just get right back into the sweet and simple
nick shaida : the game becomes better and better (even though it is technically impossible to turn car to move backwards :) ). developer does a good job!

justin greenhalgh : love the simple game but hard and fun!!
denos : they really deserve this. fun easy to play game.
dogsareverygood : my favourite game! i love how the developers create frequent updates with new interesting features each time and also the graphics are amazing and beautiful. i dont usually leave written reviews but please consider downloading if you see this game it's awesome. :)
christian perfinan : this game is very simple but!!!, very addictive i think this will be a perfect game if they add a circle route or way? because sometimes you get bored because its just a straight way with curve and looping(repeating) the area or places. and maybe if they add a location in philippines like bohol!! banaue rice terraces! and more! because here in philippines there are a lot of good views and places! im just sharing maybe they add some of what i say hehe hoping!!! but the game is reallyyyyyyy good!
junjun cui : i played this game for 5 years and i always wished for multiplayer mode. everyone agree? this game is a true masterpeice
ada still memes : i love this game! the thing that bothers me about this game is that you can't rotate your phone that you can drive the car. but the game is amazing. the graphics are awesome to. there are also ads.
sashank chandrasekar : this game is epic! i had so much fun playing it and that's because you don't get bored of it after some time like in other games. the game is completely endless and all the cars have a different feel to drive. if you like driving games get this one now!

diren singh : we to play ratio is awesome. super simple and incredibly entertaining. even better, new maps and new cars come out regularly.
steve : you're actually reading user comment? i read some negatively commenting it and some just suggest to add brake feature. now you really addressed the problem quite fast oh, i'm really impressed i know how hard it is to code such mechanic (i'm into programming too) now this game become even more special than other infinite running game by adding more control to it. you know what i will donate some when i have some spare cash
isaac lee : superb game! beautiful graphics and runs smoothly. not too many ads (probably every 5ish games) and easy game mechanics but hard to master.
cleber barbonalha : cool game, good gameplay, effective just to pass time. but what really got me was the soundtrack, one of the maps had a music directly based on "big in japan".

wendel caya : love the way you've done with the controls and the gameplay it's smooth as glass.keep it up i'll be waiting with some added improvements you've got on your sleeves.

olaf_de_barker ._. : when you pause the game i want to see the missions so if i start and forget then i need to go back to the menu and maybe add a few more cars but the game is so fun and addictive.
al mohammed yaseen siddick : really good game for time pass and to play while you are bored
cap potter : if it had multiple choices of paths to take similiar to outrun by sega, it would complete the game. potentially in #drive2? regardless fun distance racer with its own identity.
theodore deverell : really nice soundtrack, car list, ui, car customisation. controls sometimes seem sloppy but after getting used to them they are fine.
luka vekic : far best game ive ever played on a phone, good controls, amazing graphics and good money system,maybe u could add a new map like touge or mountain downhill it would be pretty cool
jason kiddman : smooth and nice graphics !!! i like the driving is realistic because the car isn't locked in any direction and you can go on a loop if you want !!!

fu22y : nice game to spend time with, i love the the control and the graphics is aesthetically pleasing to watch. overall its enjoyable.

bass & trap : what a very great headstart for a new game! this game is awesome! the voice acting is very cool too , maybe add more modes like cop mode or maybe add an retro map because when i play this game i remember 80s or 90s arcade highway driving , its just has this 80s atmosphere and its awesome , it has many cars too , money making/soda cap making is ok , its not those kind of games where you pay to get a new car its really ok. keep up the good work i like this game!
