stephen osun : awesome game. it puts you in the management seat, and gives you an insight into strategic decisions that are behind winning races.
ronnie edington : game needs a better tutor system to start u out with. especially during a race. but overall, i enjoy game. still learning things.
esa s : simplify and fast paced if compared too mm3. need reworking on driver status (like high smoothness is not significant different on race under 5 laps). kudos to dev for race visualization. the only downside is who is still using facebook as in game friend nowsday?
avik baidya : its a gud game but everytime i race even though my internet is working fine it shows poor network and im unable to do my strategy changes and pitstops properly.. this spoils my experience and is very frustrating
balazs szabo : very nice game, but lagg destroys everything. sometime it is fun to play but most of the time it is so laggy that the game stops and become unplayable. fix the laggs and i will be happy to give 5 stars.
santiago pesaresi : good design and idea, please check out the crashes when you try to change the breaks or any part between vehicles. thanks you
matthew thomas : out of dozens of live online games i play on this phone (pixel 4 xl), this is the only one that seems to have network issues, and somehow network issues translate into 1fps during races. impossible to do anything in a race.
martin roberts : a good game but it is a bit buggy in a way that it keeps freezing or on occations shutdown altogether, graphics are great game play really cool just a shame i have this bug
simon cheshire : game looks good and the concept is good, but unplayable, the minute you get into a race it just lags and lags, save yourself the download and dont waste your time
norrie rae : great game until you have to race. races are very laggy and unplayable at the moment worn be doing races until this is fixed.
kevin ackerman : this is a totally waste of time. after getting through the opening set of races i have not been able to get into a race for the last three and a half hours. yet if i wait a few moments the room appears to be populated. a game that will not let you play is not a game worth playing.
andrew schecker : after you reach a certain point the game clearly becomes pay-to-win and all the fun gets sucked out of it.... that is, of course, when the servers are working and you can actually get into a race.
des richards : the cost of development is high and the rewards for progress are very low but like most games nowadays you need to spend real money if you want better cars and drivers
wilson liew : crash when viewing your cars tab, and occasionally crash after viewing some ads, constantly reconnecting. spoils the fun.
tristo garza : a pretty good game where you can create and use your own strategy and win races. simply the best management game ever.
neil johnson : never been able to race. have entered around 20 times, find 5 or 6 players then quits the race before it starts. once it found 10 players and refused to actually load the race!
pedro santos : i'm locked in the first race, because when i was doing the first tuturial race the game crashed. when i reopened the game , the race was finished and i can't go to the next race. and i can't find a way to reset my account so i'm stuck in the tuturial. could the support team contact me?
sean gish : i like this game i payed for the vip but like other people the inability to play a game during peak hours completely ruins experience i can't play when i want i get excited to play get bounced out of lobbies 3 time in a row and i'm done! won't be spending on this game again untill fixed
ralph j : great game, but it has so many bugs, always crashes, and cars are getting black while ingame. please, fix this.
casper tong : it unplayable during actual race. the freeze just lag and then freeze. there is nothing you can do.
john smith : absolutely sucks, crashes have yet to play a full race, servers constantly being upgraded but never a scheduled upgrade when ever they feel like it its upgrading
mark gittelman : they were good at taking my money, but for 7 out of the last 8 days i can't join a race because of high player activity. support said they're having server problems. so frustrating and no resolution in sight..
apothecary : really like the game bur all the sudden the game won't load past "finding players" when i want to race so i'm unable to race and progress. hope it gets fixed soon
ricardo perez : everything is way too expensive.. upgrading a racer costs alot close to or more than their contracts. winnings from races arent alot and u need padd to race... this game heavily favors paying over free players
deepak jagpal : developer still not provided a refund and has been over a month just paid again for vip as the game does not load to race. rubbish money back please old post _______ i paid for perks at the top with every car upgrade to now in the related release have lost my progress and vip status. time to stop playing
james mcdonald : tried playing it via wifi and 4g and so buggy and kept saying poor connection yet full bars showing. would be great to actually complete a full race.
yuki : please fix the game pls. why am i unable to join a match. i've been playing for a couple of days and the game is just spectacular but then i encountered this problem.. i want to play the game more
basota18 : it's a very addicting and satisfying expirience , i wish there were some exclusive liveries that can be won or purchased to be different , also more drivers with different traits for more variety and more tournaments. make new exclusive liveries available from tournament winnings and purchase only it will help u get some extra financial support for ur game and won.t affect f2p.
patriot concepts : little explained. starts by telling you you have a bad driver. doesn't explain how to replace the bad driver. ended up spending about 800k hiring drivers to replace the bad one before figuring out how to select driver to replace. at that point all money was gone n didn't make sense to keep playing and come from behind
tommy vercetti : during the races the game it was impossible to play.. soo slow and it used to skip parts of the races.. hope you guys will fix it..
don yenko : game should be called bug manager. api request errors and 'cannot find a match' happen every few minutes. races are unpossibly hard no matter what you do. wasted several hours of my life on this, thank god i didn't make any purchases.
sd 9410 : it's a good game but not the best from playsport, after going to tier 6 you will face grind for money, and the online experience is mediocre, but its not that bad either, will play for few more days, if i feel the grind too much will quit...
jaan : i am starting to hate it, all the good features of from the mm3 or mm2 are gone, also it crashes after 30 seconds of gameplay and it continiues forever and i restarted it like about 82 times and it still dosen't work
damien ward : good game but having problems when trying to race , game stops working and said unable to find a mach and make you reset and try again and same thing happens over and over again plz fix this problem and will give game more star's.
keith ferguson : fun to play....but horribly glitchy. as of right now...4/26/20, i can't even get it to load a race. just keeps saying unable to connect, reloads the game.
myles gonzalez : been playing for a while and game recently started crashing constantly and no longer opens. please fix soon, ive spent a bit of money on this game!
dody susanto wibowo : difficult to maintain a good internet connection. my wifi or package data won't work well although my connection in superb condition. please fix it.
a. ferdian 56 : after dominating tier 1 to 5 you reach tier 6... thats where paying players dominate, with free players like me struggling to pay driver and engineer contracts and barely enough parts to upgrade and only few hundred k's of cash to spend. races goes bad from race 1, with a nearly impossible chance of winning the registration fee back... now i only race a few tmes a day, waiting for sponsor cash to register a race... definately not enjoyable anymore.
chewy rc : huawei p30 pro - game and menus run fine, as soon as i join a race it lags heavily not even allowing me to press any buttons on screen. very frustrating, uninstalled.
kenden starke : it crashed in the first race. now i got mm3 on sale and i love it. the races are in depth. but the online one crashes on the first race. where did the quality go. i'm sorry but this gets 1 star.
rayhaan maganezi : intense experience. trying to manage 2 cars going around the track.. dealing with when to pit and ever evolving strategies
dennis radjenovic : way to hard to progress, takes way too long and the race part is boring as heck. at least add skip the race progression. 1 star uninstalled
thomas adams : decent game. reliant on decent internet connection. frustrating at time and seems that you'll always lose to paying players but that's life.
damian armitage : changing review, dont rush,take your time building your team,its actually really enjoyable,steady progress. i like it.
spicer : when i renegotiated the contracts for my drivers and reduced the support stuff since i could afford to pay more, i never got them back so now i have no extra stuff and cant upgrade my cars.. please fix !!
brett warner : been trying to do a race for almost 24 hours and everytime i do i get an error message saying there's server maintenance for 3 hours. game has a lot of potential if i could actually play it.
bryden gray : everything is awesome, glitches were fixed and now it's smooth to play, good concept and plenty of fun. been enjoying this game for a few weeks
nick terzis : this is definitely my favorite motorsport manager out there but...there are a lot of connection issues and crashes that ruin the game. please do something with all these
pablo : game is good but the updates keep nessing up with the game. i can't play anymore as the latest update has me locked in the tier progression section (i have written support). otherwise i would have given it 4/5 stars.
sgg : most of the gameplay is good, but it gets infuriating in random qualifying because if you have a good car and are on softs, you'll always be in last place
stelio jennyfer : as soon as i saw the words motorsport manager i knew it would be a good game and better yet it had actual 3d model cars edit: the game is good but you should be able to change the colours like in mm3 but keep the livery shop
whirly1227 : game crashes every 2 minutes with "unknown error". i love the series but refuse to play this until this game is fixed.
nathen horsley : game crashes constantly saying it's experiencing high volume of player's it's a bs excuse i've seen player numbers high and got races no problem fix your game.
trevor hannah : runs terrible on a mate 20 pro, laggy on a 200mb connection even after restarting my handset. absolutely unplayable. it's a shame as i've bought the previous games.
ylai : the game has a lot of potential. it is buggy and it forces you to progress into higher tier races. why cant i just stay on my current tier and try to upgrade my car as much as possible so i could dominate that tier?
m pulco : poor lately, doing the race just fine, once the race finish the game switch off and it tells me didnt enter the race but yet still worn parts frame. very poor
not johnson : came back after a break and all progress lost. game forcing me to go trough a lenghty and tedious tutorial that you can't skip. too bad there is no 0/5.
steven vallis : still early in the game, hence the 4 stars. great graphics, wish i could zoom in on the car alittle more. here's hoping the learning curve isn't too steep
aniruddha deshmukh : i love this game. good level of competitiveness. doesn't force you to buy with real world money. the only thing i would love is with the livery options. add few more open wheel livery designs from the current lot of formula 1 like silver arrows mercedes, mclaren, renault or the liveries of the iconic cars from old era like legend senna's mclaren mp4/4 or black and gold lotus 79 or brawn gp1 to name a few. please bring this in...
rosyid romdhoni : frustrated! there's a chance it'll be a great game. but it keeps me no chance to play, always need to restart and restart.
serkan mecit : well, i bought motorsport manager 2 and 3 just because of the simple beauty and quality of the game. this is the online version of a good quality game.
matt baker : fun and semi-challenging to figure out different strategies that work. money can be difficult to come by sometimes because of all the available upgrades, but not impossible.
lee warren : was crashing all the time before the march 30 update, now it doesn't work at all. when u go to race it just says unable to find a match.
johnpaul negri : i really did enjoy the game but for the simple fact i tried to play this game for three days now and every attempt gets rejected simply because there are not enough people playing at one time why can't there be an offline mode or something i think it's dumb that this is basically a baby step more then an idle game and you can't get anyware in the game because nobody else plays this except for the few that have patience
sunil babu : the game is extremely glitchy and takes very long to load. if developers doesn't improve or update. this game will be utter failure.
danny v : why is this new update soo buggy? in the weekend formula races, my attack mode is ready & set, but it will not activate thru the whole race. how can i compete if you're handicapping me? the rest of the game play is soo choppy in frames now. before the july 2020 update, it was just fine.
ea paradise : what the hell is going on whenever i try to start a new race i face with "no match found" and the game restart i've been playing for a month and the game was really good but now why am i should pay this app anymore and waste my time when it doesn't work
tom smith : was enjoying this game. then my account was reset with no explanation, tried to contact them by email 4 times with no respone. spent over 50 pounds in the last month with a montly vip pass and others purchases. poor service
ben handley : can't find a match, with it being an online game, now makes it pointless. finds others players, but doesn't enter race.
chris dumbell : needs a little work but played the off line games and they are fantastic. maybe make the store a little cheaper.
mark entelis : screenloads are insanely long. restarting takes ages. game crashes a lot. all of this but still ill say it has its moments
edwin : game is great, but those tutorials as a first timer are annoying, i know it makes sense to have them but it could be selective as if i want.
stav : samsung s8+. game loads up sometimes and then says needs update. click update and it brings me to play store and says "not found". unable to play at all. please can we get a fix for this?
bo_cil oke : since the first game was released, its so amazing. bring new experience and knowledge to the people who dont know the real formula competition there. its the best management game ever.
crit - c : nothing but an mtx pushing cash grab. extremely dumbed down version of the pc version. no local single player only mode. tutorial is very bare bones.
kieran lee : was playable until last update. now races are incredibly choppy and seem to show me every 20th frame of the animation after a few second delay
dylan huckeba : accidentally clicked f1 while meaning to click stock cars and now it won't let me go back to start from stock cars. i've even removed the log in from my facebook and eveyt time it starts me back where i left off from f1. i've uninstalled and reinstalled app multiple times and still the same thing. i just want to completely restart and it won't let me.
david : really enjoyable game....when it works. the race loading is so glitchy over 50% of the time i cant find a race or i get an error.
marcus dugan : this used to be a great game, buy now it constantly freezes and runs so slowly, it's virtually unplayable.
scott gerrity : a good little management sim, only thing that could be improved is the graphics could be a little better an more camera view choices would be nice
michael sadler : was a great game untill i got promoted to tier 4, now i can not get a sniff of the top 15... i have upgraded everything to the max and got real good drivers. also says my goal is to finish 1st every race but how is that possible
paul murphy : zero stars, if that was possible, due to only having facebook as a login option. the app only has "guest" mode for people who do not use facebook (and are unwilling to be forced into using it).
georgi panayotov : i don't liked it. when the pre ios two game went out i had really high expectations about this game. i thought that there will be a career mode like the others versus the ai and i don't like this game. please make the next game better.
guru walker : when i click the video rewards to watch video the game just freezing and i closed the game and launched the game but the same thing continues i had this issue after the last 2 new update before the new update its working fine please fix it
dsg racing : pathetic, can only have an account if one has a facebook page, how ignorant, seems the only people i meet that have a fb page are losers, ive never had one, never will. ashame, as previous versions have been enjoyable.
ralph r-ben abehoyla : this game is great. but the connection is bad. to the developer, i suggest to add more female driver. in the all game. i have nothing to say,i love, this sport car manager.i can't wait to the next update...
vaughan watkins : just another pay to win race game. only play this if your willing to pay. not worth 1 penny for me so uninstalled. when u lose to paying players everytime no matter what your stats are or what strategies u use then it becomes obvious your wasting your time unless u spend!! don't take my word read other reviews & there's a common theme running thro them. they don't change it because developers only care about money!!! sad acts!
clayton brown : if you liked the other games from the devs, you won't like this. it's a cash grab. not realistic. crazy boosts you can purchase. more pay to win.
dark heloizea : i have to reinstall multiple times! 1st time reinstall due to game stucked at loading even restart many times, 2nd time reinstall due to cannot retrieve from failed to retrieved fb profile then have no option to change profile
daz griffiths : game constantly stops when trying to enter a race. was fun to play when it worked but now it's just a buggy mess.
an burrito : a solid game all round, microtransactions are pretty obvious and the endurance is pretty pricey but not necessary, would love rally added
im3agle : i keep getting an error and having to restart while navigating the menu. fun gameplay but crashes pretty often
ernesto salazar : graphisa are great but the mechanics are built for a p2w cash grab, upgrades and part builds take materials and time to build, which of course you can buy.
fathoni ridlo : latest upgrade is worst. always show notification poor connection when the wifi or mobile data i used is very stable. force closed is more often, please fix it
pang henry : always shown poor connection while my home fibre is high speed broadband. lagging issue cause ranking from leader to last. please fix. thank you.
achyar nur sohid : dude, please fix your game man. it's always disconnected for no reason and ask for a restart in the middle of the race! its really annoying, i think it is getting worse since the last update.
matthew gammon : i loved the older versions of this game that were actually challenging but now all you do is tell your drivers when to pit, you cant even mess with there set up.
chris alexander : was able to set up my team but nothing else. keep getting the message that server will be down for the next 3 hours. glad i waited for this to download. please fix or remove from marketplace.
rafael raupp : game is broken on pixel 4 xl. for some reason it's completely laggy when you enter a match... this should be fixed asap as it makes the game unplayable
lighter games studios : cannot compare with awesome motorsport manager mobile 3... this is.... bad... worse than bad... im a big fan of mmm3 but this.... i uninstalled it after a while... its a bit pay to win too so... no... this is not a game which i could call a good game...
pinn sinratchatanan : i was rating this game for 5 stars, then i found a major bug. my hq upgraded stuck at level 8. the countdown doesn't start. the admin of facebook page doesn't reply me. please fix asap. until then my rating will be 1 star like this from now on.
zacktiger121me : rally didn't expect to be this good. just started everything is good untill i can went into race track were i didn't had any tutorial of how do i do pit stop or which tire i put or what are those energy things are should have been explained otherwise great game, i recommend to mature audiences
zombieslayer : pretty good. could be better but good. i just dont like how you cant give your drivers commands, go faster, go slower, block, etc.
benjamin mayo korompis : now we're talking, great job guys i reinstall the game after the fb login crash, now the game runs perfectly like i or we the players want, thank you i know this motorsports manager game never disappoint the player. keep up the good work
aviceinna el hadi : i have a problem, when i download and install it from google play its works and when i connect to facebook its become not responding and force close, when i restart the game its not working and says something wrong error 1001, and i have no idea a how to get playing again, thanks.
aman saini : it connected with wifi and game shows poor connection..really game was too good due to such continuous issues am going uninstall it.. disappointed with technical team..
andrew botha : awesome game but you battle to race, always pops up saying they are experiencing high volume and you have to wait most of the time it kicks you saying you unable to connect
hjalte kielstrup : very fun game, i have also played the previous versions. but it is absolutely unplayable due to constant lag. please fix this.
fariecha hady : gameplay was amazing... but i've got many error when in the middle of race and crash apps... but my money and driver contract still pay...
fred schnepf : pay to play game. you keep running out of money. you have to wait ages to get sponsoring money etc. waste of time. there's no balance between other players unless you spend real money in the game. 1 star.
nick gatto : runs like a slide show on pixel 4, even with smooth display disabled and on wifi. very disappointing since previous mm games ran flawlessly.
chris b : love the concept. gameplay is good. app crashes 2 out of 3 races. keep working on it!
scott scout : getting 3 issues since the latest update: 1. unable to find match please try again. restart 2. one moment please motorsport manager online is experiencing high player activity. you will join the game soon. quit 3. error error code 1123: /client/getuserreadonlydata unknown error restart. get in touch
agung widodo : i love this game...before last update, new server is suck...and the rival is unbeleivable. 3 position then clinch and i drop down to 7. i use soft tire and power bost...and i can not pass my rival using hard tire. wow
teddy jusman : loved this game... but now so many errors on race mode, ask for restart the game all the time, and sometime can't find the match...
aditya widyantoro : ive been playing this game for 2 days. and now i even can't play anymore, always end up with sign "unable to matching". this game has 20k online player at that time and can't even matching 10 people?
harold thambipillai : unplayable the minute you start a race. it just lags, button presses take forever. very juddery even with settings at lowest
will gladulich : the concept of the game is excellent, and how it plays is great. there's still a few issues that needs ironing out.
justin schram : it loads way too slow and always seems to lag when you go into a race or go into any modes on the home screen.
tiago jh : i have a big issue with this game... i start playing and then it's 3 hours later. pilots training should be more diverse and cheaper. keep up the good work
dino : another mobile game made lazily. even if you max out everything it gives some people a 2 second a lap advantage and let's them blow away. if they made it fair and actually skilful, this game would be awesome.
brendan onyejikwe : challanging, insightful, fun, and progressive. it is a great game if you have some time to kill, and not be board.
praveen : its a good motorsport manager game . ui is very user friendly and i never had any lag . well developed game. -
seb brd : mm3 is my favourite game on mobile, unfortunately the only version is too greedy and require a lot of payments to move forward in the game, not a great game experience. can't wait for mm4 !
italo ramos : it's always showing messages telling me that it can't find the race.. the game is good, but it seems like the server doesn't comport the amount of players
david tupper : i want to like the game ..i really do. however most of the time i'm unable to play. takes minutes trying to get in a race only to get "unable to find match". all day yesterday and so far today the same thing.
jakub sobczak : lmao spent about 40 quid on this game before. my phone failed to work. got a new phone and it's all gone because i don't have a spyware facebook. no thanks. i'll stick with mm3 which is actually good or igp manager. really disappointed you don't use google play games like every single other game at this point. 0/5. kind of like a bethesda or ea owned game at this point. please give up on making games if you're going to force people to sign up for other media other than what your game is sold at.
jason yang : hello, this game is extremely choppy even when settings are on low, sfx off, music off, and vibration off. playing on a mate 20 pro. i had no issues playing mm2 or mm3
a a : good game but always crash and to get back in the game take a long time to load. shouldn't waste that much time just playing it. getting bored waiting to load.
adrian postolachi : may be a nice game overall, but the connectivity makes it unplayable even while switching from 5g wifi to 5g data for comparison! not recommending!
giandomenico cassano : i like the game till when it starts lagging and you fxxk the money and the cars. it's not cause my connections for sure. in this case you should give back the money to enter the race.
paul degraaf : it's a good game, but getvmore the 15k people on it and their is zero chance you'll get a race in... servers get too over loaded. a couple messages will pop up and then it'll ask you to restart the game over and over.
stephan goldschmidt : it is unplayable. every race is lagging so bad, can't get in your pit stops. don't know what's going on in the race. really frustrating.
jonathan stokes : don't enjoy the expensive packs and free to play model ... much better before as a one off purchase, will be the first motorsport manager game i won't play since the release off the first.
sportsdad001 : pay, pay, pay, pay..... to play graphics are great... if you run out of funds it might be a couple days watching videos to building them back up so you can race. or your driver's will demand more than you have and quit... leaving your team unable to compete at all.
wesley huang : high volume of players??? 18200+ online players kill the server! i can't get into race anymore, tired with the loading screen. it's not high volume, developers, go get better servers
justin jenner : fresh... honestly a fresh new game with new concepts. great start developers. when i get more into the game i will give a more detailed description. great game.
gary williams : outstanding improvement on previous version! love the new look and it is easier to play and still challenging!
erik dillow : awesome attention to detail, whilst not too technically challenging. definitely a great game for motorsports enthusiasts!
thomas mager : after getting to t4 cant even compede if you wont push huge amount of cash to game to keep feeeding nonsence til you get over, coz you get only expenses per race so you cant renew contracts build or upgrade stuff. absolute nonsence simulations, cars doing so silly overtakes that im gonna eventually puke from it...
kane lisman : enthralling game, quite a bit of fun trying to manage it all but once you have the feel of it its a bit addictive.
sean c : they fixed the couple of issues that were serious but now that i'm in t6 i'm blown away.. so it cost 500k to enter the race.. i needed to get 1st place as always to get the bonus 200k or whatever it was and it says 1m+ as the top prize which btw was t5 top prize.. make sense??.. so my first race i came in 2nd and 10th .. i won only 600k!?!?!.. so 100k profit for 2nd place in t6 !??..winning is almost impossible now unless ur pumping 20+$ a day into the game. i can't even resign a driver
edison piedrahita : game is good but getting parts to upgrade the car is difficult and can't have 2 good drivers are the same time can you guys make easy to get parts to upgrade
tim ngiap yoon : i love this game but each time im in a match, the game tells me to restart due to a "not finding a match. please try again" and forcing me to restart
david meredith : had the game 3 weeks updated everytime there's an update emailed developer twice and still can get past the loading start screen could not have had a worse experience
ryan parks : was alright when i started but now all you get is "unable to find match" or "high player volume" then you need to restart and repeat.
elie sarkis : thank you for your help and solve the issue of downloading the update. also thank you for the reward, you are making a great work especially in that coronavirus period
sir gil : absolutely fantastic just wish there was an offline arcade mode for those boring moments on a road trip or time you don't have wifi for an extended time
kozloff : nice game. though there is one bug where upgrading the facilities, it pops up with something like "dsfghd dhfhhshfhs dhfjshdgshd". plus, there's a lot of iap's, which is annoying.
brandon mildon : overall pretty cool game. i think it should be more in depth. more car, race, player options. game leaves me wanting more.
niyaz shaffi : its unplayable now. everytime i try to get into a race, it throws error. unable to find match
david masheder : awful, constantly crashes, never even close to winning a race and far too conplicated with way too many sub menus and variations....deleted
toby s : leave in unloaded for now, race's just glitch and freeze up constantly so you can't do anything. like the idea etc but also you won't get a stock car, f1 and formula e on the track at the same time... no one who was involved a motorsport fan? lol
brett mimaran : several days now i have attempted to play since installing it. even after yesterdays alleged update i still have no access. i'll try again in a few months. uninstalling.
bayupermadi 55 : its too buggy compared with the offline version (mm3). always freezing in the main menu & on the ad service
andrew caldwell : would rate a 5 star but the game constantly freezes i'm looking at load screens more than the game and it hardly ever froze until i put money on it now i cant even watch a video to half my build time
filip cleeren : after 3 ever improving games in the series and an excellent desktop game, this is a step in the wrong direction.
jesse martineau : great idea, but as soon as you race it's laggy, like unplayable laggy, i'm on a pixel 4 xl, shouldn't be an issue.
john asirrh caridad : except for the ads money bug, everythings perfect. the economy is great that no player would be powerful even if the players winning constantly.
mike knotts : i love it i love the new idea i love being the manager i love watching instead of having to deal with it it's more realistic if you're nascar fan i think you will really like it takes a lot to get used to though i still suck at it
kostya morozov : full of bugs. main one being the liveries just disappear from the car midway through the race and all cars are just black. ridiculous
elliott daniels : it is a fun game when it works. first day the game crashed after every race. the second day it wouldn't even connect to the race.
idiotic girrafe : way too laggy! the game would be great if you could actually see what you're doing. i had moments where i was at 0 fps for 3 seconds
blackfire : really good racing game! good graphics and games runs smooth but requires a good internet connection. other than that 10/10! would recommend
jorge leao : good game so far with nice aesthetics and nice game play. i have only played one race, so i will be updating how it performs on the long run.
daniel wamono : it would be cool if we could swap money for tokens. tier 6 upgrades are really token heavy if you don't manage to collect enough materials.
tom harvey : love it. enjoyable game, just a bit buggy at times with difficulty accessing races.
swatantra singh : when it comes to collect the event rewards, the game always gets restart and i am not able to open the game. please solve it !!
simit shah : good game....but give us a camera switch option to directly see a track from car ....and just also give recommended contract of driver so atleast we can accept it and driver can join immediately i gave a good deal to driver than also driver left ....it's bad ....so please see the above points ...overall 8.5/10
graeme marsh : i signed up for the vip pass for first time only to be annoyed that you still have to watch ads to claim certain rewards etc, this is utterly ridiculous.
uday dabas : this is much much better game then f1 manager.i like the whole mm series but i think that they need to make the prices a bit more comfortable.overall a really good experience.mm 3 too easy so yeah it is definitely an improvement
liam a : literally cannot finish any race. constant glitches and freezes where the game goes unresponsive.
itz joe munroe : this game is wonderful. i've been playing motorsports manager mobile for a long time and now i get to do it online. the only thing though is i would like a practice mode.
christiaan dique : great game but now after the event i get a pop up message stating that i have to restart or raise a complaint. i've raised plenty of complaints nothings happening. please help.
irma lopez : whenever you have to upgrade parts and drivers it gets confusing, but it doesn't matter because the game is still fun.
gareth diamond : looked good on into soon as trying to find 1st unable to find race 5 times on bounce what a joke of a games times out way to soon get to 5 to 7 players then just quits what a waste of time u need to go bk to drawing board what a failure when u can't even start game loooooooool
damian ellis : very complicated for or average person is looking to play for a minute and not be all super in-depth into the game have a life outside the game
psr surya : absolutely disgusting ! to be short, you cannot be on top unless you buy in-game cash with real cash. in any game if you are on top you should be receiving ample in-game cash. but this idiot developers force us to buy with real money. if you don't buy you can never come above top 10. that's how they designed the game. it's like the developers play the game rather than us with joy. fktsrds !
jeff love : completely unplayable on my huawei mate 20 pro. lags beyond belief to the point i didn't even finish the first race because i had no idea what was happening. shame because it looked good.
muh han : video reward make game freze sometimes. it is ridiculius to pay upgrade for driver in early tier when same amount of money can sign new driver with stats above current driver. and driver upgrade is ridiculius expensive. you forced to do it in higher tier. in summary it is pay to win.
zhuoluo chen : crashes after connecting to fb. i tried connecting to fb, following which the game crashed and does not open anymore. please advise
emmanuel conde : fun while it works. it is unable to connect to players consistently. tried 7 times in a row.
yannick b-fournier : good game in general! but you need a good internet connection if not you wont be able to play it. i still think motorsport manager 2 is the best of all 4games!
paul layman : beautiful cool graphics...quite tricky...i wish there was tutorial with like a arrow of a hand pointing what to do....but it's a cool game...nice graphics....cool fun game
afiq harith : this game actually great to play, but unfortunately its so lag that i cant stand to wait or close the app, i don't know what causes the lag issue. please fix the lag issue if you want more user to use this app
dare dream : i enjoy the game.... but i want to say that to the game developer if you add a feature that we can see the map on exhibition match than it will be good for us. thank you.
peter ganzon : love the game, but need more prize money for races. i've got to wait to make money and its starting to get annoying.
sargent silver : not happy with the game, progression wouldn't be reached unless i open my wallet. other players who pay for the game would always be on top. if you are a person who doesn't put money into games this is not a game for you.
yew wei : the game crashes when i link into my fb account and restart it. the game is not playable for me unless i reinstall without linking to fb. please have it linkable to google play as well.
steve : takes plenty from the base game (motorsport manager) and introduces multiplayer elements. great fun, well paced. microtransactions don't smack you over the head.
brian cooke : its a con. as soon as i completed tier 3 it was unable to find matches, i wonder if its because i haven't bought any of their rip off packages?? why would they want people playing their game and not making any money!? they don't answer twitter complaints, its as if they know!! pay and you'll find matches after tier 3! don't and you won't, avoid!!!
glenn wood : a pay to win version of mm3. mm2 and mm3 are great. this free version has a pay to win mechanic so you end up with less racing and more watching adverts and waiting for hours for timers to upgrade stuff. just buy mm3.
douglas duncan : the game keeps shutting down on me during races. there is a bug and it better be fix, the update didn't help
5012 likith. v d : a great game to play and enjoy. having a great time playing it. but i have a great problem. can you add google play games account to bind it . please update it fast . please send it
russell dickinson : they ruined what was a great game, it's always lagging, the good features of 2 and 3 have been stripped and anything good you have to pay for, don't bother with this game, download mm3
chris wilkinson : would be an easy 5 star if i could actually race, constantly telling me due to high volume online it can't get me in a race, reset and repeat.
remarc balisi : very nice game. not really familiar with how race works but i enjoyed playing this much. this gamr has smooth graphics and experience.
prashant joshi : this game has been totally screwed after recent update. i join a race ; automatically logs out of the race ; app restarts automatically. what have u done guys. please test your application thoroughly before releasing, pathetic!!
clint van hoesel : it is not even online and way too easy. edit: recently tried it again, but logging in with facebook leads to crashing on 61%
wesley coppersmith : fantastic! it's graphics are good to and even though it says car manager not only do you get to manage but in a way you also drive
tony : it's a great game but the problem is that i made an in-game purchase and although money was taken from my bank i did not recieve anything in-game. it's straight up robbery.
dominic pilling : impossible to find a race. otherwise great game just wish could see what the driver wants from contract like on mm1 and mm2. also to be able to renegotiate before it expires
justas putelis : awesome game but.... its so lagging. i did enter my first race from second time. green lights. coming to the first corner and thats it. i believe we finished first lap and i'm stuck at the first corner.
aryo budilaksono : the game is quitting itself when i log in to facebook and now i can't play it again because the game quiting itself all over again when i launch the game please fix it. thank you
alex patrick : i a great game and i like it the way of managing but just too lag to play the game.. when racing.. keep on laging and press the pit button and not even pit at all..
lee etherington : good game to pass time but could do with a driver training option to help keep stats at a competative level.
sam ogier : kinda disappointed if i'm honest, the lack of an offline mode makes it boring really. the removal leagues and fact that i have to pay for any cars or livery ruins the game. i'll stick to mm3 thanks
dsofronea45 : its very fun at the start but when u progress its to hard your just crawling round the back and it gets very boring that your not fighting anyone at the front
adam blanchard : total rubbish. i've had this game for 3 months and have not been able to get into a single race. kind of defeats the purpose of a racing game when you can not race.
iqbal satrio nindito : ridiculous lag lately. game was running like in 5 fps or 10 at max. my internet is fine at around 50 mbps and the game was fine some time ago as well. something is broken in the game server i think.
bill watts : game crashed on first race, now always gets stuck showing the tiers and can't click anything to progress.
joe breezy : it's a good game up until it doesn't work. haven't been able to race for 2 days now due to "high player activity". if it's as low as 9k or up to 20k people, it says the same thing. then it cant find a race.
andrew williams : very poor game looks great but when i go to race its really slow and buttons don't respond to touches for ages phone is a huawei p30 pro. works on my old huawei mate 10 pro so not sure what the issue is
angga andika : a shame, that this whole game didnt connect to google play games. i lost my progress because i thought google got me safe but it turns out you need to sync to facebook to save your progress. a shame really
thecarguy123 : i love it especially being a big f1 fan only one thing maybe we could have a more in depth practice events and more in depth quali but other than that brilliant and would definitely recommend it.
raymond noah : i really like the concept of the game and how they made it but the only problem is once you log onto a race it lags so you can't see anything or it will not let you race at all.
mushthafa kamil : i even can't start race after 10 times trying. always automatically fail after 5 or 6 players connected then ask me to restart.
eric dhulst : since downloading, i have been unable to race. keeps telling me that it could not find a race. i'm in wifi coverage. i can't comment on game play, because i can't play.
jacob dyer : i've had this game before and it was playable but now after reinstalling it crashes on startup everytime so i can't even play it now.
adenoah1 : it one of my fafrot games or thoe when you start the game its horendos but it gets better through the cureer so great game but not the best its cud be.also,there should ve more possabilitie of rain,sc,vsc and red flags to make it intresting.also when you are a pro can you make your own f2 f3 team.that would be effic i hope people agree with this in rhe coments below.(and this game is about strategy and the driver not the car and can there be legendary drivers when you have the hq facilaties don
graham douglas : not sure what's happened but game is unplayable now. doesn't run smoothly and now missing laps and driving on water.
chris litton : terribly laggy. servers look to be chocked as constant disconnects and game neer unplayable. will not return to this or any of your other games.
mark wheatley : keeps telling me to update but there is no option on the playstore, very annoying and poor service, unistalled and reinstalled and no difference
dennis ng : just endless ads. previous versions were so much better. such a shame it's just become an ad platform.
sanket barik : i cannot play this game anymore. this game is pay to win. how can i compete with players with higher stats when i do not get rewarded. also the match making is so ridiculous how can i compete with players 500-600 ratings above than me.
ashley chick : game seems ok, however the race is very laggy and jumpy. makes it poor to watch and borderline unplayable.
john nicola : awful, error code after error code, then crashed and caused my phone to freeze.. i have a new galaxy s10 plus, this game is unstable. uninstalled!
zian michael quiling : it started all great but when everything gets expensive, everything gets difficult.. i got poor and upu need money to get more money like what?! its a pay to win game i saw so much offers that look like that make you win.
silvio scicluna : addictive racing game. the only problem is that no matter how strong your network signal the game suffers from poor connection most of the time
riley tomlinson : excellent, why? the interface of the game is so simple to understand... the gameplay is so intriguing and the overall gameplay is amazing, great game!
berkay erinmez : there are lots of bugs and crash i hope u fix them and its freezing all the time its really annoying needs to be stabilized
blist : it won't let me make pit stops ever since the new update no matter how many times i cancel and try to send them into the pits they don't ever go in and it only seems to be me cuz everybody else can pits just fine
you wont even know : it was all fun, until at some point i cannot swap tyres before the race start. when it was raining heavily, all your opponents were using wet tyres, and there you were the only one using soft tyres.
ace gaming : 2 stars for now up untill someone fixes the insane lag in garage.. game runs smooth as silk in other areas edit.. i sent a ticket on the 19th october 2020... no response as of yet.. downgrade to 1 star... update no response yet 13/04/2021
jb breig : good game, great racing strategies. just wish i could schedule pit stops more than just one lap in advance.
chris moylan : its not bad, i have one question for the devs, would be nice to add individual status for our drivers. how do you know how many races they had won? not your overall states bit it would be nice to know how many races the drivers have won
george geeko : this game is so fun, but i get "poor connection" all the time. i have very low latency, my bandwidth is 100/10 but the game is still impossible to play. i know it can't be my fault.
vic holland : first all its a very good game to play however i have lost many coins & pit tokens due to fact once your race starts we lose connection. why is this when i know i have strong enough wifi signal in my home its bloody infuriating when we bulid your cars to a good standard only tolose racies and money & postioning in league tables.can someone explain why and there is a way round this issue.many thanks..
kyle lloyd : everytime i try to enter a game it keeps saying that i cannot be matched into a game. has been happening for the last 48hrs now. i have now sent an email to support
what only : a brief resume: - almost freezes my phone while exiting app - unbalanced as in when you start not obtaining enough good results, you will need to wait for sponsors or pay - good gameplay afterall
steven moxon : stopped working. got to 5th tier. paid for premium and now the game won't load. frustrated as it's a great game up to that point.
tobie essam : enjoyed the offline version, so far this is good, let's see how much it changes once you start moving up the levels?
devepr 07 : this game is a ram eater and it making my phone so laggy all time. i'd rather play big storage game than ram eater game like this one. if this game eat 3/8 of the game, it would be 5 stars from me. you just need to improve that issue before your game gets worse than this.
jose roman : awesome game exciting on each turn, very competitive just a few cars to race with but customizable designs.
zintax d'zinner : very good game but now im stuck in the loading screen. giving a 2 star until its fixed. i was flying high and then i cant open the game past the loading screen.
msg kh : this update got a lot of bugs, please fix it, i'm tired of downloading again and again to play. once i got to waiting for player part,the game keep loading forever. i will give 5,after u guys fix it
petar stoj : i love the game, bring the qualifying style from mm3 into this, only problem is it crashed quite a lot, i have an oppo r17 pro. but good work with the game :)
nicander rizky : the game is fun, but i'm getting frustrated as the app keeps crashing when i try to watch a video to get more cash.
philip nulty : very slow to load and also slows the whole phone down considerably if you don't fully close the app.
muda sulaiman : this is a really good game, maybe this is the foundation for mm 4 ? i really think that livery editor will be pretty neat. it will be very good if you can add the feature.
willie malherbe : losing money and tokens due to bad server connection is frustrating. don't bother if you don't have the patience to try and connect numerous times to race.
clement chang : super laggy, i'm having stable wifi, the game keeps saying that i have poor connection, caused me so many wins, all because the lag made me pit 1 lap later (crucial because the game normally only have 10 laps or so)
robert dixon : can only play for a certain amount of time before it closes really enjoying the game and struggling to play longer if this don't get resolved then i will delete the game
wayne martinson : there is too much lag to enjoy the game, there is an issue with the game freezing up. what i have gotten to play of it, it seems like it would have been a great game.
algirdas gricius : constantly kicked out of the game because of "high" player count. in reality it's 3000 people online. maybe it's time to invest in the infrastructure?
benjamin dzul : please please please make an offline version of the game. it is fun, but i just want to play this game offline because it has formula e and other racing cars.
jamie cashmore : super laggy, cars just drive off the track. miss laps because of lag so then. miss a pit stop. get the connection sorted and itd be a 5* game
philip faster : good game, but you need more money to get faster upgrades. or you could grind with lower score to get more money first, with the drawback of lower your avg winning position
samuel voss : very well designed game. options to buy but not necessary to advance through and enjoy the game. thoroughly recommend for any motorsport fan.
ukasz jaworski : unfortunately game keeps crushing when it's loading, and i can't play it at all. it started when i linked my account with fb any chance to fix it?
mohd shah muhaimi harun : i like it soo much! i was not able to race after reaching tier 4 connection error kept occuring even though i have full coverage on my network... why is that???
paul grijalva : this game is terrible. because you can have a good driver and the best parts for your car. and qualify highly and not ever come in not even in third place
yuvinder singh : hiring a new driver is unpredictable. how am i suppose to know what a drivers maximum requirements before i make an offer. i need to know what are the requirements so that i can negotiate. otherwise i can not hire good drivers and it completely destroys my momentum in the championship. please make an info column in the driver's stat about there maximum requirements. i would also recommending adding an academy where i could train young drivers, and hire them, lease them, or sell them.
acap rodriguez : it is indeed a good game. good gameplay. you can choose which cars your team will be driving. that's cool. highly recommended.
ashwin s ashwin : having an issue while playing, error occurs unable to find a match re-start i guess there is a bug in the app check
tim wells : required facebook sync for data mining your account. you can play as guest, but don't trust them now. uninstalling now.
mark anthony vista : i keep on disconnecting. i've got a stable internet connection yet every 15 mins i get disconnected from the server.. can't even play or properly set my profile.
shahz khan : it is my first time to this game install experience is not good but i like this game my childhood to veido show graphics are very good car are very good and this game is one of the most wonderful game and this company to prepared this game a lot of work day and night special special thanks to this company thank you so much
shaunix tech : great game when you can play. always "higher player activity, you will join a game soon" ... but you won't. 2 days of trying to play. don't bother.
david ambrosio : good fun game, just poorly optimised, get a lot of client restarts, uses too much battery and makes my phone get very hot. please fix these issues
mohamad gassama : it's a really good game where you can lead your team to glory. mainly it's about strategy but it's nice to be actually race people from around the world. that's why i am giving is 5 stars!
craig lee : all about the money!!! i understand that teams need to get paid but this is a bit much now. could easily spend about 100 on this game. shame really as i used to love it
daniel guastella : just started but if you follow racing in general, you should find it easy to play and figure out how to get the most out of your experience with it.
ezra wong : sometimes prone to freeze. but restarting phone will fix it. gameplay is excellent.
bertus minnaar : this game is what i always wanted motorsport manager to be. the iap is expensive, but so far i am in the platinum league and tier 6 and i could get here without spending 1 cent.
cozma valentin : at all time when i intro the race is problem with internet connection ( my internet is fast like 120 mb, i play call off duty on the same internet and is working perfectly) it's the worst game i've ever played
darryl darnell : update killed it for me! new update removed driver startigies that were critical to my own stratagy that i spent months delveoping, and just like that they fu*ked me! im done. deleted the app and never playing again!
jake law : rubbish game. very very glitchy. does one lap fine then glitches out and just take a long time to do anything. had high hopes for this game and let me down
jonathan arocho : fun but also can be a little laggy at times. it is a little difficult to customize but with some time you can be happy with what you got
aaron campion : everything i hoped for. really was looking forward to this game. have encountered a few stutters but im playing on s8 which is an oldish phone. really enjoying the game
jack woodhouse : i love the way the game plays but, i cant get past the first race everytime i finish it just loads on please wait and freezes.
mariusz peterewas : everything is all good except the gameplay it lags so much you can even play it , says poor connection even tho i've a very good one and same thing on wifi , how can you make a online game that can't cope online ? sort it
ajith subrammanya : the game is very good but it crashes the moment it is started i cant even start the game before it loads its getting crashed this is happening from 3 days
christopher and jodie liu : fun game to play but i don't understand how you can roll over the finish line in first but the car is retired and then you are last.... the car finished the race
dark faust : i wish there's some livery design option especially red color on formula car and also that can be design by ourself instead of buying it with expensive price.
daniel ramos : bad. complete waist of internet. there are so many better games than this. don't waist your time playing this game. hafe the time it does not connect properly.
kartik lele : if they can add a proper racing experience besides management, this can be one of the best racing games!
semako lokosu : they are always updating and updating. they should just update every 2 months not every time. and the updayes ate always large asnif u are downloafing the game itself. it should'nt be so.
matthew rybicki : great game, i played all three of the motorsport managers and i loved all of them but this one still has a lot of bugs and everytime i offer a contract my game crashes:/
adrian aspel : good game but seems to always kick you off the game when you come 1st and 2nd and don't give you the points just kicked me off 4 times in a row that's 160 points i've lost out on
yak yak : complex and addicting. never thought managing a team would be as fun as driving, but this game is lovely.
asyraf asyraf : take note: can you update the motorsport manager 3, to have a same real car like online but still can play it offline because i really like the game. thank you.
misham koli : why does the game hang every time before i start a race? i have to close it and restart it again but the race has begun. i keep losing matches because of this.
samuel duncombe : i'm getting less than a single frame per second, making it utterly unplayable. phone is a huawei mate 20 x. no issues with any other games.
kn4cka : great game but do you know what would be a great feature, allowing us to login into our account before! you force us though the long tutorial!
dick mcharden : laggy, fix the issue. i havent been able to race is 2 days due to high players on server. this shouldn't be an issue all day every day.
sean bridges : was a great game, i even put money in but havnt been able to race in 2 days. still building up my car but every race keeps timing out.
anshumaan bag : after the latest update, there is just too much lag. just fix the lag and i promise to make it 5 because it actually deserve it.
robin falber : the game told me i was entered into 2 races this evening around 2245 hours this evening uk time but i had no control over the cars at all. in one of the races there were no other cars on the track. no refunds given. please refund .
will boler : i was approaching the final tier and thought this game was going to hit a deadend, but i love how they did the ranking and development system! best racing manager game out there!
ben coles : app crashes all the time - looks like it could be a good game but at present it's unplayable.
mark kenneth ferrer : i really love motorsport manager both on mobile and pc. but this is so laggy. i can't even play it decently. i hope devs will optimize it.
uros stevanovic : very addictive and challenging game. races are not boring, sound is great and tyre wear rate is excellent.
willswhittington : laggy and less enjoyable than previous games. previously played mm, mm2 & mm3. excited when i saw this game in the store, it's just not as enjoyable. not a fan of the micro transactions.
king geji : what happen with the qualifying? doesnt matter how high your quali is but somehow you will be pos 20 and the pos 1 on hard tyre. the quali number isnt showing either on the race. fix it,!!!!
tedy ardyan : sorry for the 2 , all vehicle on my device have no tire at all.. dont know if its a bug or spec problems? on mm3 everything seems okay, every vehicle i play have a tire.. looking forward for follow up this issue
viraj kapse : a bit of grind is required but still the game is a bit fun....i request proper qualifying with different aero and gear ratio setup with different tyres
gail breeland : terrible. was an okay game can't join races for over 2 days now. uninstalled, cleared cache, cleared data. dunno. uninstalling.
m curry : honestly i would love if it worked but i can't even pit and it's so laggy i don't even know what's going on . awesome concept really disappointing.
paul andrew : race day seems buggy to me was unplayable laggy slideshow, the game has lots of potential tho once the bugs are gone.
kaleb waters : keeps saying unable to join game and making me restart the game every time i try to join a race. i've tried emailing support several times now and have yet to receive a reply
rob yarnell : unplayable, races are very slow and jerky, by the time you try to pit on lap 3 suddenly it's lap 7 and your driver is just pitting have fallen down the rankings because tires are low
phenyo casper : this is an awesome game to play, very addictive if not careful. spend your money wisely coz as the game progresses, you will need it :)
savio mendes : i guess it would have been better if they made a version 2 for pc that concept was far better come on guys this is going down a very different path and too early
jason dewhurst : your previous games were great, this one is full of connectivity issues and i will not continue to play it when your servers are so poor.

bucky stevens : reviews don't help if people aren't telling the truth, facts! i'm giving a one star rating sense after the tutorial the game doesn't want to let me ter up or allow me to play further. cheers
pradeep prasad : while the overall experience has been good. i give it a 3 rating since multi player has not been working for a week.. no support has been provided
colin wan : great game but the game lags sooo much. other games runs so smoothly but i cant even play the game or navigate the menu without lag. need to fix the game imo
jerrith reynolds : even better now with cars not just dots but no matter how good my connection is it still has lag problems and crashes occasionally. 5 star when fixed.
christian stone : i really like the game but it crashes constantly lately. says i will connect to a race but just restarts
theron1n : to say, the new online feature looks great! there are some problems, but i can handle it!
lubano dennis : no star is the only rate, wasted my time downloading this game and i can't even enter the game, i launch the agame and it tells me error yet it's my first time getting it i even don't have an account, done with you guys
eddie neufeld : unfortunately i have not been able to race a single race due to an error message that says the server is under maintenance. this happens every time i've tried over the last while now
fred price : incredible gameplay and impressive graphics. second time playing and still love it.
jamie mcpartland : changed device and couldn't get my old game back as i don't use facebook. developer has not replied to email to resolve issue. loss of progress and almost 16.00.
gabriel karoma : when you reach tier 5 its really dissapointing, no qualifying, grid position randomly choose by the sistem. what kind of racing is that? lol
james newbould : decent game. maybe just not quite my cup of tea and if you have poor signal you just can't play. worth giving a try though. looks like it might be good
craig manson : great game, would definitely welcome more crashes and retirements. my only issue so far is the game force closing fairly often for no reason
ross lancaster : good gameplay, but the glitches are very annoying and keep me from racing when i want at times.
farel revalino : worst, i cant even do race. using low end spec device and crash so often even in main menu. wont bother install on my tablet. im wondering why the developer brave enough release buggy apps lol
everton elvio koser : this does not should be called motorsport manager. look, the game have it's appeal, but this is not a motorsport manager game... it's a f1 mobile clone... i would gladly buy a real motorsport manager 4, an offline game.
aaron wong wen jin : can't start a race! it always stuck at the loading page of waiting other players ?? i try to reopen the game it won't work too feel disappointed with the developer
j.a. e. : love this one,, been a fan of formulae for a couple of years now , and be able to manage formulae team is really awesome , keep up the good work guys
t craigie : used to be great but now can't get into a race. error message every single time - not worth the time anymore sorry.
a 2906 : great game, however almost impossible to move through the career if you don't pay and quite frankly it's expensive in some countries like south africa
jatinder singh saini : this game taught me how to watch f1 actually. how complex this sport is. one of the best game. it's so addictive if you have the brains to understand the stargegy.
vanderson lucas : guys i'm with a bug, i'm starting always with soft tyres, even in rain, i put the intermediates and i start on sorts besides that, the game is absolutely entertaining.
simon carr : seems good so far however after the first race and some upgrades the game now crashes when selecting view car.
oliver rangel : very few games that are not pay to win and this is one of them, as long as you make the right choices you really don't have to spend a dime but if you choose to, you won't empty your wallet trying to get something
ken chips : this game has too major issues it's laggy & constant connection issues, you can't put unless you do it on the first lap as the game doesn't recognize or respond to it
barbov mitko : pay to win game from the begining it was okey but when you go in high classes you are not earning enough ressources to pay all these things and of course you have to pay in real momey if you want to continue or simple just give up games without knowledge and pay to win are rubish games!
nolan tate : the further you get in the game the more frequently it keeps crashing, and like any free game you can only do so much before you are expected to pay
jayr baldago : always crash!!!! dont waste your time for this game. i think this game needs to update server and create more servers, suck over crowded servers always crash!!! poor gaming
kr muhammad channel : don't waster your money in this game.. suck. even your spend alot money to upgrade car still lose with low power car. wth. qualify top 1-2 in race easy drop from position 1 to 20 like stupid.

amri mohd bakri : been playing up to tier 3 when i decided to login to facebook account. the moment i login to fb i cant play anymore. unable to load. ive lost my purchases
niko zabkar : fun manager with some strategy options but slow progress for casual gamers. i recommend it to all petrol heads, at least.
wira chandra : vip does not worth it. winner prize too less, everything else cost too much including investing to a single driver & assigning/renegotiating contract. waste of time
mike hjorleifson : didnt even play. had me download a half gig..then said update another half gig for additional files. no thanks. that's abit much not to mention the fact it should be just one download one time. from the play store.
ryan huang : bug that didn't allow me to race because of "high amount of players" has disappeared. back to the rating it deserves.

maplefoxtm : i hate when the match started, the game force-close for no reason, man i hate game like this, my device was ok, my ram is 4gb, but why? pls fix this
bilal ali : at the moment they need to fix bugs the app loves to crash when i click to view my car it crashes right now i'd rather stick to f1 manager
daus99 hussin : i test this game. the game is okay not bad. the game realistic and you can see you car when race different from offline you can't see car when race. but for me i love mm offline version.i hope playsport can make we new version mm offline better from mm3.
sulaiman sulo : i've been waiting for nearly 1 hours for the loading to finished.. yet it still can't play.. at first it went well and then after that i can't open it

ville laaksonen : literally unplayable due to lags. really loved the first 3 in serie so it's petty that the devs are cutting corners and didn't get this one right

aji rama : you need to spent your time to watch ads everday to improve your hq,car,driver,etc. and the rewards from the race is pretty small too . i prefer the old motorsport manager than this trash
calum lynn : i remember there was at one point another free offline motorsport manager, and i loved it so much, but now it appears to be gone, and i am left with this game that just isnt the same at all
a google user : this game was very good until the internet went down and i accidentally clicked restart and now i have lost all my progress.

monroe wardlow : sucks its slow tutorial is slow and painful plus it's horribly optimized and and it crashes constantly.
hasan kuadrat : i give the best car to 1st driver, but it say i breached the contract of the 1st driver, because the traits of the 2nd driver +25 performance make the 2nd driver's car total performance higher than the 1st driver's car performance. how can this happen? are kidding me?

avishek saha : create more exciting and more competitive in the game, even though i am giving 4 . some time i feel that same process is going on and on.
nuke taco : the server connection is appalling the amount of lag makes the race look like trash the driver negotiation system is a joke no matter what u give them they will just reject the contract racing in the same league is also terrible as you could have 75 rated drivers yet they race like 5 year olds the game just isnt fun motorsport manger 3 is way better
john chambers : would be good if it actually had cars with tyre changing and refuelling. like f1 clash but can be better as f1 clash has no refuelling and too much of slow cars forcing you to slow up
sudhanshu sharma : game is amazing....but 4 stars becoz the seasons are small,the energy gets low much faster....and part building time is high

golam rabbani : game is gud i think but i couldn't play a single match.....i tried many times but it only showing unable to find a match.
marcello pelagalli : i have been a fan of playsport for years. it was very sad to see they joined most developers in the greed race. mm3 was perfectly balanced. and they sold a well made game for a price. full game. now it is a constant cost. maybe it will be good for kids milking their parents...
peter s : started well but now struggling to get a match = less earnings = demoted from "hard fought to get jnto" better leagues. frustrating.
kade neal : the t4 e cup is impossible i have a level 10 engine when it jumps from required level 9 to required level 13!! i cant get gears i need 300 gears just to get that how can i get it if i cant even compete in the cup please reduce that
jay cupp : poorly optimized, loading screens take forever and the entire game crashed 3 times in the first 5 minutes of playing
emaxx74 pew pew : amazing and fun game
daniel struve : fixed the race problem. why do i have to assign way more ataff to dricer when renewing contract? they aleady have set number fron previous. did i loose them? they dont cone back if i negotiate with another driver. please fix this. you can only hire so many crew workers

choo hoong ow : it is very laggy on my nova 5t. most of the time when instruct drivers to pit stop, but it will never happen.
mohammed ek : i love the game. it is a very challenging game as well. the thing that bummed me was it was that 2d kind of game.
niko tarateski : the game crashing everytime, ridicules that basic thing that this game should provide it's the ability to race but it's just crush
e. c. : fun, but when it takes 3-5 attempts to enter a race makes this game very annoying.
mohammed razeen zaeen camil : it's not as fun as mm3, the races are short and should be longer, the menu is a headache to scroll through, generally i think mm3 is still better than mmo
eric quintin : annoying to wait for money......of course if you spend real money like all other games you dont have that problem....its fun to play
raymond furda : one of the better racing games that's out. where you do not have to pay to win. great job, well done to all

harvey prout : was really enjoying the game, but for the last 2 days it won't load game. even did the latest update today still won't work.
joe wahba : this game has the worst contract negotiation mechanics. no rhyme or reason. you lose your best drivers with no warning. pass on frustration and avoid this game.
sumita barman : this game is awesome but one problem if found is that the tyre colours not match the f1 tyre colours . for example soft should be yellow and not red
halizam rosli : best game ever. thanks team. you've done a master piece of games adapt with real time strategy. you're the best.
jonathan seng : the game does not let you use energy when you want it to be used and slowly losing place bc of the game
