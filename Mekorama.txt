theminibeaver : giving this one star since i literally can't rate it. why? damn thing won't even open. i click it both from the app store and my home page, it just opens to the developer name, then stops. when i go to running apps it doesn't even say it's running. might help to make your game uhm, actually open long enough for game play?

faaithhh : this is the best puzzle game ever. i will never delete this game. i recommend all humans old / young to download this game. i write this review because i can't pay, sorry martin magni.
xii mm 1 - rifqi mj : this game is kinda wasted potential. this could be as popular as gd if he keep updating it and if he were really serious with it. this game still fun, but its just your clasic 2016 mekorama, really nothing new this game editor really simple and doesn' t require you to have at least 80 in logic, it just you, your hamd and creativity. that it if magni is releasing mekorama 2 im sure everyone will exited about it
pratik gore : this was the best game app i have ever played. this is really a challanging app. it forces you to think in a logical manner. its graphics are really brilliant at very less mb. i recommend everybody who likes to play some brainstorming games to download this app.
bhuminjay markam : so simple yet difficult (several times) to reach the spot. and the buildings are beautiful. nice game to take a break and pass the time.
karen etheridge : a fun game that has you solving puzzles, the robot is cute, some are quite challenging and frustrating but you keep on coming back for more

joseph van gessel : brilliant game, fun, smooth, well designed and executed. plus no annoyances or grinding. needs to be more games like this.
krys anywhere : lovely game! levels are just challenging enough to be fun without being frustrating. i'd love to support the creators financially, but money is a little tight right now. :/ that's not to say the game doesn't deserve it or that i won't do so in the future.
swift ace : perfect game... makes you think a lot and doesn't really give you a free pass. you have to pay for hints and which i think is smart.
keyblade sora : the game mekorama let me tell you guys that i don't know where to start. simple to put this is that it's challenging and needs more levels. i would love to see more games out there like this one
crow smith : i love this game. the style is so cute and the puzzles are so interesting and the little stumble that the robots do when you move something too fast makes me feel bad.
christian devotional songs : i don't have the money to give you but this is a super game. that the player can create the game. awesome experience. small app but really intresting game i recommended to all of my friends
fatih sonmez : a must play. edit: after playing some levels i can easily say that the developer is genius. level music is created by your moves. levels are fun. it lets you build levels and play the levels created by others in a 16*16*16 world. all of them are free :d
oxrello : wow! this one is an awesome puzzle with the best mini 3d lego look alike. love to play it. keep up the good works, dev. :) just start playing today & im still curious with create page. wonder if we players can create anything then post to you dev teams to be featured, or what.
franklline jay : the puzzle are good but some of is not especially when clicking inside a building. you cant move inside. and also the camera angles should be free, not fixed.
vishal saraswat : it is a very nice games and it's main character is also so cute and the thing that gave it five stars is that is has a feature to build your own level and it is only of 9 mb .wow so much fun only for 9 mb. the game is much better than any 30 to 40 mb games so i really really recommend you but i should give my opinion to the company that you should have given an gmail log in so that our progress remains to ourself if the games is deleted by chance that happened to me . thanks for this cool game.
frostyluke91 : this game makes me comfortable... it makes my stress gone and satisfying motions and smoothness... and less mb and no ads supports.. i love it for real.. even it makes me confuse but still i learned alot of strategies...

sunil boga : the game is simple and yet has powerful graphics which doesn't seem like it. it would be great if you can show the number of stars in the game on the screen above hint icon. i have to pause the game and check for the number of stars there.
datar rusttar : i love this game! it's just great like hopeinggo always says it's great because it's great. anyway i give it 5/5 it's a really fun game you can make your own level it's just great i even made a captain toad level
piyush rahi : totally dumb game. no tutorial, no video of how it's gonna work. just a block and have to go throw it with no jump animation either. either keep watching ads to get same hint again and again or pay money to get subscription
google gmail : seconds into the game it's already stopped working. every time i swipe to move the platform, the whole diorama moves instead. there's no way to differentiate commands.
tabrez mohammed : this game was 4mb as far as i remember with same excellent graphic back then when i used to play 6 years back. 10mb yet with all the updates these years is impressive. reinstalled it, got fine memories with it.

nikhil munde : very unique game and new concept. every level is kind of new challenge. i had to uninstall this game because my kid was addicted to this.

asbo uk comfortable : good game, too time consuming, after a quick teabreak game. suits kids, not for me. takes too long to load! not for me. refund my expensive uk data at 80mb for 2 plays now! time wasting. deleted asap! cute graphics! 2/1/22. uk review

sreeraj n r : this game is really mind boggling. it's very simple yet brilliantly designed to include it's complexity within the simplicity. mr. melodrama, the cute little robot's movements are extremely natural and childish. i sometimes felt sad for abusing him to finish the game. anyway this game makes you think deeply. it evokes the thinker in you.
delores grahek : this game is both cute and challenging! it also allows you to skip a level if you get stuck. very well-designed game!
aakash mohapatra : what a cute and beautiful game. it is amazing and addictive. need i say more. very simple though could get tricky once a while. a game worth wasting your time on

mark chester banay : a great way to pass time , it's has nice graphics and awesome gameplay. i suggest buying premium to get a hint when it's too hard.
andy allgood : this game is great! it's a fun little puzzler with excellent sound design. it's worth trying out to listen to the music alone.
pushkar dubey : as the level of this game increses, difficulty level as well as curiosity increses. interesting logical game. one more thing about this game is that if you want a hint to solve any level you will have to pay 30inr, 50inr, 100inr & so on. if you are not able to pay then, no problem you won't proceed if you like the game you can write a review, wow ! what an idea sir ji ! i suggest this game.
nik mish : simply the best mobile game ever. no exaggeration. challenges one to think creatively. and shout out to the creative efforts that went into the app's design motif, consistent fluid feel and just the entire experience. hands down martin magnificent is a g, see what 25years of mastering your craft brings forth. :) looking forward to more (it's a shame i'm poor, otherwise i would have made a significant donation to your indie studio) keep up the mag-nificent work!

praveen benakannanavar : best game to pass time. they even gave built in simulator. it's awseome . i loved this game ,suggestion: i spent my half day to build a game of mine but there is no social media link to show off it with my frnds . sorry bud im paying you 60rs (cuz of my budget). this game deserves more i know
marcelo vera : it's an awesome game! my kids love solving each puzzle and driving meko to the red dot. it's such a lovely character!

faraz huq : martin. you've done a great job with this game. the fact that you let us play it for free and then left it to us to determine it's value is incredible. i have never seen any developer do this and it's nothing short of brilliant. you obviously worked hard on this game and judging from the love it's gotten it paid off! congratulations! looking forward to your future projects.
terrance johnson : the game isn't puzzling, it's fustrating. why would u make the character move involuntarily towards tazers and bots. it's borderline annoying. also stop asking for money so frequently. did u want the game to be free for everyone to play or did u think it wasn't worth paying for? just label a price on the app store or add a place to donate for it.

barmi mandal : i love it. its tricks the mind, but the music and beautiful simple graphic dilutes the pressure and make it such a soothing and refreshing game.
anjeela singharia : this game was good, it also has options for designing your own level, but you have to purchase the hints. that's the only drawback. overall a very cute game.
ananda dahal : i could have given 5 star but some issues is found by me. we can't upload our levels in forums. after completing 3 levels it will show black screen and we again have to play that same level. these are only my issues please say me that how to upload our levels in forums. thank you!
amar nath : this game us really nice... has a good graphics very simple concept i love the levels... it is easy at first and becomes tough at last... we can even create our own levels... it is a very simple but an intresting... funny... good timepase game... try this game it is really a cool game...

shouvik mukherjee : very interesting...and tricky game... it's for all ages... the graphics is really so good...has to apply your brain...and it can help to develop the geometrical view
jordon kraft : too many ads, but fun idea. it asks that you allow ads "sometimes" but it's an ad after every level.
julian gordon : i find the game challenging. though at times frustrating, as it is unclear how to move certain pieces. but so far it has been intriguing.
mothy beats : i think it's an amazing game for it's like 6 mbs of data, the puzzles, the physics, the graphics are all awesome, definitely keeping this hidden gem on my new phone!

shraddha patil : really interesting app with brain chllenging levels. if someone likes puzzles they should definately try this game once. the graphics are really great.

deepak sir ntp : hey martin, it's a great game for every age group. you can think, make strategy, enjoy and make your own stages. i made some children to play this game who were addicted to shooting/firings/fighting/racing games. it's better than them and doesn't spoil their mental health.

umberto grimaldi : to be honest this game is really bland, the physics are wonky and the levels are super easy, it's practically pay to win since you can't use hints since the game just expects you to know everything about the mechanics of the game, really sloppy, i don't reccomend.

luca gubernati : game is ok. puzzles are quite easy and doable. the real challenge is to fight the unprecise cumbersome tap/drag system.

ignacio lima : pretty fun, but annoying and tedious at times. also the message asking for donations every time you do something gets very annoying.
venkata sai balaji sattaru : hints should be given for some levels instead of pay and take method. otherwise it becomes too tough for clearing some levels like lv 19 robo valley . coming to game it is the best game i have ever seen from my childhood under 10 mb

michelle borlor : an undo and redo button would be nice and it would be nice to keep the field straight rather than being in isometric.
