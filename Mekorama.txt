andy Konrad : Best game in a long time!! I flipping love this game! Challenging, quirky & addictive There's 1 level I can't finish due to my tiny phone screen. But otherwise a phenomenal game.
Talha Ibn E Ali : It is good game but when player enters in room or something like that the outer structure should become transparent so that we can see inside structure plus there should be more camera rotations and brief description written with name of levels

Upas Parvan : The game is absolutely addictive once you get a feel for it. the controlls are simple and smooth with a simple objective in the game.

Tisha Beedle : This game is very enjoyable even though it's not very challenging. It's similar to Monument Valley, so if you enjoyed that game, you will like this as well. I appreciate the relaxing nature of this game. It functions well and you can tell that the devs put forth a lot of love creating this. Very nice job!
XII MM 1 - Rifqi MJ : this game is kinda wasted potential. this could be as popular as GD if he keep updating it and if he were really serious with it. this game still fun, but its just your clasic 2016 mekorama, really nothing new this game editor really simple and doesn' t require you to have at least 80 in logic, it just you, your hamd and creativity. that it If magni is releasing Mekorama 2 im sure everyone will exited about it
awadh : I found the game back, installed when it was new after so many years I found it again. Nostalgia.
Pratik Gore : This was the best game app I have ever played. This is really a challanging app. It forces you to think in a logical manner. Its graphics are really brilliant at very less MB. I recommend everybody who likes to play some brainstorming games to download this app.

Jason Van Cleve : Touch interface is ridiculous. Must have pressed twenty times on a target, and no response.

Joseph van Gessel : Brilliant game, fun, smooth, well designed and executed. Plus no annoyances or grinding. Needs to be more games like this.
Krys Anywhere : Lovely game! Levels are just challenging enough to be fun without being frustrating. I'd love to support the creators financially, but money is a little tight right now. :/ That's not to say the game doesn't deserve it or that I won't do so in the future.
Swift Ace : Perfect Game... Makes you think a lot and doesn't really give you a free pass. You have to pay for hints and which i think is smart.
keyblade sora : the game Mekorama let me tell you guys that I don't know where to start. simple to put this is that it's challenging and needs more levels. i would love to see more games out there like this one
Crow Smith : I love this game. The style is so cute and the puzzles are so interesting and the little stumble that the robots do when you move something too fast makes me feel bad.
Christian Devotional Songs : I don't have the money to give you but this is a super game. That the player can create the game. awesome experience. Small app but really intresting game I recommended to all of my friends
Fatih S√∂nmez : A must play. Edit: After playing some levels I can easily say that the developer is genius. Level music is created by your moves. Levels are fun. It lets you build levels and play the levels created by others in a 16*16*16 world. All of them are free :D
Sophia Muriithi : The game is okay but why is it that some features are not working. An example is the vertical lifts how do you bring them down?
Oxrello : Wow! This one is an awesome puzzle with the best mini 3D lego look alike. Love to play it. Keep up the good works, Dev. :) Just start playing today & Im still curious with Create page. Wonder if we players can create anything then post to you Dev teams to be featured, or what.
Mothy Beats : I think it's an amazing game for it's like 6 MBs of data, the puzzles, the physics, the graphics are all awesome, definitely Keeping this hidden Gem on my new phone!
Franklline Jay : The puzzle are good but some of is not especially when clicking inside a building. You cant move inside. And also the camera angles should be free, not fixed.
vishal saraswat : It is a very nice games and it's main character is also so cute and the thing that gave it five stars is that is has a feature to build your own level and it is only of 9 mb .wow so much fun only for 9 mb. The game is much better than any 30 to 40 mb games so I really really recommend you but I should give my opinion to the company that you should have given an gmail log in so that our progress remains to ourself if the games is deleted by chance that happened to me . Thanks for this cool game.
Yashvardhan Kumar : Kudos to the developer for such a GAME...which is simple to understand but complex to solve at the same time. Demands out of the box thinking and creativity to solve levels. What a gameplay. (P.S. pls add new levels soon. üôè)

Sunil Boga : The game is simple and yet has powerful graphics which doesn't seem like it. It would be great if you can show the number of stars in the game on the screen above hint icon. I have to pause the game and check for the number of stars there.
Piyush Rahi : Totally dumb game. No tutorial, no video of how it's gonna work. Just a block and have to go throw it with no jump animation either. Either keep watching ads to get same hint again and again or pay money to get subscription
Google Gmail : Seconds into the game it's already stopped working. Every time I swipe to move the platform, the whole diorama moves instead. There's no way to differentiate commands.
Benjamin The Engineer : Relaxing, peaceful and i get to take my time?? Followed by really great graphics and simple controls? And i get to feel smarter? You've had my curiosity, but you now have my attention. Bravo, Devs! üí™

Aldrei Henrian N. Pontejos : I cannot upload my levels due to QR code decompression. I don't know why but If I compare my level's QR code to other levels, my level's code is tightly packed into a medium-size square, unlike the other level's code which literally fills up the entire QR code box. Please fix this issue.
ASBO UK COMFORTABLE : Good game, too time consuming, after a quick teabreak game. Suits kids, not for me. Takes too long to load! Not for me. Refund my expensive UK data at 80mb for 2 plays now! Time wasting. Deleted ASAP! Cute graphics! 2/1/22. UK review

Vaishnavi Singh : Very nice game with unique features like : we can create our own levels and share it with our friends. Kudos to developer.
Sreeraj N R : This game is really mind boggling. It's very simple yet brilliantly designed to include it's complexity within the simplicity. Mr. Melodrama, the cute little robot's movements are extremely natural and childish. I sometimes felt sad for abusing him to finish the game. Anyway this game makes you think deeply. It evokes the thinker in you.
Delores Grahek : This game is both cute and challenging! It also allows you to skip a level if you get stuck. Very well-designed game!

Chris M : Couldn't get past round 3. Kept trying to move one of the blocks and it wouldn't.
Andy Allgood : This game is great! It's a fun little puzzler with EXCELLENT sound design. It's worth trying out to listen to the music alone.
Techno _savvy : The game is really interesting and fun. It makes us think a lot to solve those puzzles. I really preffer this game if u like to solve puzzles.
Pushkar Dubey : As the level of this game increses, difficulty level as well as curiosity increses. Interesting logical game. One more thing about this game is that if you want a hint to solve any level you will have to pay 30INR, 50INR, 100INR & so on. If you are not able to pay then, no problem you won't proceed If you like the game you can write a review, wow ! What an idea Sir ji ! I suggest this game.
Nik Mish : Simply the best mobile game ever. No exaggeration. Challenges one to think creatively. And shout out to the creative efforts that went into the app's design motif, consistent fluid feel and just the entire experience.

Faraz Huq : Martin. You've done a great job with this game. The fact that you let us play it for free and then left it to us to determine it's value is incredible. I have never seen any developer do this and it's nothing short of brilliant. You obviously worked hard on this game and judging from the love it's gotten it paid off! Congratulations! Looking forward to your future projects.
Terrance Johnson : The game isn't puzzling, it's fustrating. Why would u make the character move involuntarily towards tazers and bots. It's borderline annoying. Also stop asking for money so frequently. Did u want the game to be free for everyone to play or did u think it wasn't worth paying for? Just label a price on the app store or add a place to donate for it.
Sara Sechrest : Really having fun with this. Great art style. Fun, challenging puzzles. But lowkey and casual. I love it!

anjeela singharia : This game was good, it also has options for designing your own level, but you have to purchase the hints. That's the only drawback. Overall a very cute game.
ananda dahal : I could have given 5 star but some issues is found by me. ‚Ä¢We can't upload our levels in forums. ‚Ä¢After completing 3 levels it will show black screen and we again have to play that same level.

Shouvik Mukherjee : very interesting...and tricky game... it's for all ages... the graphics is really so good...has to apply your brain...and it can help to develop the geometrical view
Jordon Kraft : Too many ads, but fun idea. It asks that you allow ads "sometimes" but it's an ad after every level.
Julian Gordon : I find the game challenging. Though at times frustrating, as it is unclear how to move certain pieces. But so far it has been intriguing.
S Sudhir Avinesh : The game has a lot to do with our brain. It provides us puzzle-like experience. For 10mb, this is the best game that I would recommend.

Tushar Rathor : Its a good brain roasting game . According to me and my known players this game should many of its bugs and unknown tricks should be told . And last but not the least a vertical orbit moving should also be involved in this game.
chandreau suarez : I once played this game it's so terrific so tricky and amazing but now I don't play it because it starts lagging when there's so many robots or the device I'm using because this is so old tablet I'm using but still a great game.
Naheed Salma : Great Game and Great Author. This is the kindest a game developer has ever been, that I don't have to pay for anything and I can just pay what I want for what it's worth. It's just great! All the other developers should be kind like you. Thank you for this beautiful Game:-)
ananta dutta : Good game but some logic applied in the game is what I don't admire and also draggable block is much glitchy I try to pull right but it went left and also quite tough to move maybe because I play in mobile screen.

Anamika Pathania : This game is mind-relaxing, with mellow music and sounds. The graphics are picturesque, minimal ads and puzzles are well constructed with cute characters.

Nandini Yadav : It's an amazing experience playing this, the graphics, the details, the structuring and the puzzles everything is on perfect set with bg music ofcourseüòå
Ankit : The graphics all are good. But this game is more of a reflex training than an actual brain twisting puzzles game. Gets boring after sometime.

jason moniz : The new UI could have been better. The bottom section (story, master cards, build and you )could have been shorter in height

Sarthak Kapoor : Man!!! it just makes me happy whenever i play it. Best concept,Best visuals,Best graphics Giving it for free is kinda donation you did for the whole world. Cause if this game is not paid then i don't know which game should be paid.
Bilakich Begum : Loved the whole game but had to delete it because of one issue, I can't even see through the little lanes or hallways whatever you call it to analyse how I'd get out same with the levels with water I can't see down there so how do I know where to go?? It's like playing blindly..... Please fix those, I love it and I'd love to download again.....
Hisham Osman : So l saw this game in another game made by the same person Martin Magni called fancade this guy is a genius every single bit of his games are simply amazing the soundtrack the controls the game itself it's just so well made and the idea of making these well made games free then maybe if you could and want you can pay some money to get small perks that won't affect the game

peter stavrou : absolutely stunning and challenging game, i love everything about it, the graphics, music and the smoothness is spot on, great job dev !
Jeff DeLooze : Almost fun. The reliance on weird motions makes it unruly to play on a phone touch screen. Too much tricky maneuvering not enough puzzle.

Otto B. : Brilliant game for a toddler! Relaxing music and sounds, yet fun and logic thinking promoting game. Cute and funny robot. This is a game I would happily have payed for for not having any in-app-purchase offers. The author has really thought through the levels he created. Thank you!

Ashutosh Patil : Too much ads.. ads actively interupts gameplay, pauses game to show ads. Ads in between levels are fine. But pausing an active level just to show ads is not acceptable.
Deepak Sir NTP : Hey Martin, it's a great game for every age group. You can think, make strategy, enjoy and make your own stages. I made some children to play this game who were addicted to shooting/firings/fighting/racing games. It's better than them and doesn't spoil their mental health.

Will Johnson : Beautiful game. Great art style. Love the music. Overall, this artistic indie game is amazing to play and even more fun to finish.
Umberto Grimaldi : To be honest this game is really bland, the physics are wonky and the levels are super easy, It's practically pay to win since you can't use hints since the game just expects you to know everything about the mechanics of the game, Really sloppy, I don't reccomend.
Mahmoud Ahmed : This game is great and used brain very good. Every level I feel like I have a new brain challenge. Not like most of the games repeat itself.
Joshua Kamugisha : This is a MUST HAVE app for all the puzzle and maze lovers, its very essential and my go to app to whenever i want to intellectually stimulate my brain. Its an absolute time killer, not forgeting its soothing music and funny robots. Well done Martin.
Luis Genaro Alvarez Sulecio : I really enjoy the puzzles so far, they are engaging an even though they are fairly simple at the start (I'm by level 15) they're very entertaining.
Oz DeVil : I really love the game and it is very addicting. The flaw I see is that it is not only intelligence you need, but also motor and sensor abilities. This flaw is my personal view and should not be taken very serious

Kymberly Clayton : We can't afford the game, but I promise if we had the money I would definitely buy it for my 5 yo severe autistic grandson.. This is one of his favorite games... Not sure if he's playing correctly but he can build his little honey off...üòçüòç
Sushant Kumar Bunty : There is a problem in seeing the whole dimension because of that I have to play some level by just plain assumption. Like in level 9 Temple Of Athena. You must add a full maneuverability of the whole scene in that level otherwise there will be a whole lot of assumption

Jean Malgapo : I can't say anything negative... Really. I love how quirky and fun it is. I get flustered each time I try a new level. Some of the puzzles remind me of the stuff from Alundra or Wild Arms back in the day... Whooooheeee what a ride!

SYLVIA CORDOVA : This game great. But they make no allowances for people who have not only paid for the game but even paid more than they were asking for. I guess they are only interested in collecting money no matter how they get it. No matter how many times they charge you. Money grubbers

E DiAngeles : Puzzles are mostly trivial... The challenge is the ui and visibility. You will get nautous after a while rotating the 3d models over and over trying to make out some path. Sound is also horrible, apparently by design to make you feel immersed with zappy robot.
Komal chaudhary : It's a very good game.... I love it a lot. When I played it first time I thought that this is boaring... After completing 6th level I found it more interesting... I was so curious to reach the end.. And I won the gameüòäü•∞

Jeremy P. Gunawan : Very challenging but rewarding to finish that one pesky level. No ads. Pay what you'd like.

Luca Gubernati : Game is ok. Puzzles are quite easy and doable. The real challenge is to fight the unprecise cumbersome tap/drag system.
DanyTPG : The developer keeps begging you for money. There is also a rare bug where if 2 NPCs get to a corner at the same time from 2 sides they keep headbanging each other and get stuck not being able to progress their ways which forces you to restart the level
Sudarshan Thombare : Very very good work. Love the concept and love the game overall. Graphics and movements are great.
Super Princess Celena : Awesome! I would definitely pay you for the game, but I can't right now. I don't know if it is my emulator or what, but the game music is so distorted it even sounds eerie. Do you have an idea about what could have happened?
Pinky Jain : I love this cute Mekorama. The way this robot walk is so funny. Awesome game and superb graphics!!! Plus it doesn't ask you to pay for anything. You can pay as much as you want. Please make more games like this üòä
Banita Mallik : It's very good but some confusen have in this game.robot is very funny control is good but not fully move what i want and one more thing is good that we can zoom.I do not see this game before. Very good game but not for children please download it. Good mind free game.
Puppet Plays : I love this game but can you make it so we can see everything because sometimes it super annoying when I have to go somewhere I cant even see but other than that amazing game with NO adds
zael wond : Absolutely loved it!!!! Great game, new concepts are introduced slowly so you get used to it. Can play without internet. Made my nights. Thank you! Love love love!
Ignacio Lima : Pretty fun, but annoying and tedious at times. Also the message asking for donations every time you do something gets very annoying.
Venkata Sai balaji Sattaru : Hints should be given for some levels instead of pay and take method. Otherwise it becomes too tough for clearing some levels like lv 19 robo valley . Coming to game it is the best game i have ever seen from my childhood under 10 mb
Rick : Addicting with great graphics. Wish the image could be rotated to any position rather than predetermined spots.
Michelle Borlor : An undo and redo button would be nice and it would be nice to keep the field straight rather than being in isometric.
Jetlash .B : A great game but the 'make your own level' feature could do with some work. Other than that, the game's splendid.
Abhishek Suresh : It is good puzzle game and its graphics is nice. It is a very tricky game and we wnt to burn our heads in the harder level to solve the puzzle
