attack helicopter : please i have days worth of game play on this game maney weeks and the energy and item cooldown is something you really need to get rid of some times i don't touch the game for a couple days because of how hard itis to progress further down the line.but then theirs all the microtransactions that i have to do(witch i'm not doing) is crazy. i shouldn't have to watch adds and pay money just to play. i might uninstall the game. and i haven't seen an noticeable update in a while. read your reviews.
chris read : you will never find a game more laden with scummy practises. this game is never intended to be completed unless you are capable of dropping a casual million and play religiously everyday.
