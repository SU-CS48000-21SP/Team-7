Fikriadi Muhammad : Good
M. Percy : Great
Widodo Dodo : Good
Ashiqur Rahman Mallik : Getting ready to an important valuable fight of life while I find this..You are helping me so far.. Just wishing that you wont make me grind too much nor my wallet so I can say that I like you (Just Chapter 1) and you deserve single player awesome story based gameplay with more sequels; new adventures/class/ventures timeline. I see portal puss*bilities along with two thousands more with you. Then again, you are mobile and free and am poor but hopefully wise...Awesome so far üî•üî•üî•üî•
Jakub Parzychowski : Very nice casual game. Gameplay is enjoyable and controls intuitive. Cute graphics. Does not force you to pay for anything and bonuses for watching ads are adequate.  All in all a goo little game to kill time.
Aamir Bilvani : Great Diablo like ARPG, optimized for the mobile. Only issue I sometimes have is during a fight with a switch nearby, I end up touching the switch instead of the enemy... otherwise a fantastic game.
Ardamar : I'm loving how hard it is. Not a simple game and the controls are spot on. Just rather confused if the items do anything or are pure cosmetic.
Tim B : Lots of fun!  Zeldaesque for sure.
Dan Harvey Ong : superb game! bought anti-ad and some pirate chests to support the devs! good job!
Zabi G : Game is fun, nicely-crafted, but the controls leave you desiring for better.
Rares Lisovschi : Thank you.
Mr. Shelby : I like it
Bong Francisco : Love it!!!
avid wolf : THANK YOU for using actual gameplay footage in the video preview. Now I actually KNOW I want to play it right off the bat!
yobjj 321 : This game is good for killing time
SIMONE DB : The game is very easy
Cluckadoodle Toons : Well made game. Every level seems different and not repetitive. Some of the controls can be a bit annoying but overall it's fun.
anshuman anand : Having a lot of fun, addicting,good for spending spare time
Matt Griffiths : This is a great game. Easy to pick up for short 5-10 minute sessions, or just keep going and play for hours. IAPs exist, but I haven't yet felt you need them to progress which is good. I purchased remove ads to support the developer. One thing I will say, the cost of cosmetics could get REALLY expensive. Maybe it should only increase in price when you get a new item instead of every draw?
Syakirin Mohamad : Love everything about the game! The only thing that I want in the next update is, can you make so that we can interact with the heroes at the main screen? I love to see they're jumping around but sadly I cannot do anything with them.
Ahmed Saad : Why is the money almost useless in the game? Why can't I gain experience points if I fail a stage?
Mahmoud Fath : It's a great game. I would give 5 stars but controlling is very bad
A Google user : Not a bad little game! If you're a D and D fan! New gamers probably won't like this game! If you grew up on Atari and intellivision! IT'S PERFECT!
Patrick Wong : Pretty fun game. The progression is at a good pace and the graphics are cute. I also like the multi-touch to split group.
Ajit Kane : This i most interesting game i have ever plas but we can take very less heroes
Pomagrenade : I'm not bluffing but this is probably the most fun I've had playing a game ever if u don't download ur missing out on a lot of fun!
Jonathan Willis : The game itself seems simple enough but some of the adverts are a problem. Like final fantasy advert, there is no close button, you are forced to close and reopen the game to get back in.
James Emus : Don't change anything  o love ot
Anton Hall√©n : Bland, and too much hand holding
Abhishek Singh Chauhan : A totally addictive game.If you are bored because of old games then give it a try.You'll not be boredüòâüòâüòâ

Adnan Faruk : Awsome
Mayur Shukla : Awesome
Dan Walter : Fun
Andrew Rickard : I think the tutorial level design is good enough, you don't need to hold my hand for me to figure it out. It makes the game feel even easier. Let players discover the problem and solution, they will feel more rewarded in the end
Joel Davies : Easily one of the best games on the play store. Yes it gets difficult, but I've not spent a penny on gems. Its made me rage quit several times, but I can't stay away for too long.. Incredible game.
A Google user : Would have rather rated it 5 üåü , but the live goes off too fast and take much time to get back, you should , add that the I st and 2nd stages be played without using life.
Ollie R : Gets difficult quickly, i.e. they want you to pay money for gems for revivals quickly. Unless you endlessly grind the boring and repetitive dungeon.
Jesko K : Very innovative controls. It's really f2p. Since last update no experience from dungeons anymore. But fast reply from developers.
dominic Anthony : Fun I'm homeless and I can still get away for a good time thank you for such a great game
Robert Heptinstall : I love the game but hate the depressing music. Can you add the option to just turn off music and keep the sound on? Will move to 5star
DarkCogar : Gets very difficult, kinda impossible but till then it's amazing
tony waldroup : This is some garbage ass gamplay
puppet life w : the game is good but I'd make the free reward come every two hours

Gisela Barreto : Awsome
Derrick DeBenedetto : A simple and fun game. Found this by accident and I never find good games. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a quick fun game with great replay value. Don't have to play it for more than a few minutes but could pay it for a long time without being bored.
Kings Refuge : Well first off. Great game. Now here comes the but. Its great till you get to around lv 25. At this time you have at least 2 stats that are so rare its irratating. For example: triple shot for mage n archer,  20% HP for defensive players, Sacrifice apon death heals party,  10% slow.
east paw : I really liked it at first, but after a certain point it becomes a chore to try and improve your party. The devs are pretty cool though and respond quickly to bug reports.
Michael Greer : Barring the usual free-to-play shenanigans, this is a very fun game. It has elements of many game types, including puzzle, action, role-playing, and strategy. The advertisements are not too numerous, allowing a good amount of fun to be had before they start rearing their ugly head. While I would much-prefer a game that is able to be outright purchased, I understand that this is the current state-of-affairs for mobile games. Now, let's see if this game has legs...
Makalani the Damskii : Its a cool game. Doesn't require a big commitment of your time. Stages are not too long. I recommend this game for the line standers, passengers, lazy job, etc. Great game devs.
A Google user : 5 stage of tutorials? Gotta be kidding me stop telling me to do stuff and let me discover the game by myself!!!! Plus boring gameplay could be worse I guess
Marquis Mazyck : After awhile, it's not even about just fighting anymore.  Mostly dodging traps and solving puzzles.
H Man : Could not get past the touch screen at first, but I reinstalled and it's all good now.
A Google user : Woah! This game is really Cool! And bro can you make the health bars visible at all time? that would be nice :)
Red Cloud : Error when saving game to cloud. It takes a very long time but doesn't even finish.
Tridip R. Hazarika : Fun, unique and rewarding hero-collecting/strategy game. The in-game rewards are generous and there are no paywalls. Definitely a 5 star game.
Austin Hennequant : I've only played the game for a few days so I don't know about the long run, but this game definitely is an attention grabber
ALI ASGAR JAFFERY : IS IT A GAME OR WHAT IT IS SO MUCH FUN WHEN WE PLAY IT ANYTIME I LIKED IT THANKYOU FOR MAKING THE GAME. üòÑ

Tom Paiboonsin : Simple casual fun game to kill times
Melvin Varsim : Reason why I use my phone

Aryaman Emmanuel : A really good interesting game , filled with action and adventure would recommend this game to everyone.

C GEOFFREY GAMING & MORE : Hi, wanted to do a nrw review. I am LOVING what the dev or devs did to this recently. I'm not sure when an update was done but it turned out cool. You can spin ( using in game coins from enemies) to get stuff you can equip & there's some new thing that makes you more "intimate" with other characters in your party although I'm not sure what happens when you max this out yet.  Only thing I miss is getting the "marks" of repeat heroes so you can level up your exusting characters but it seems you can just level up anyway by playing long enough. I do also like the fact you can now "sell off" crappier/ lower level guys for in game coins that you can "spend" for stuff like prisons
kevin sayers : Fun game, terrible tutorial.  No where do they tell you about the CP, attack, health, and how you should put together a team utilizing these different stats.   EDIT: the new update made the game terrible.  They‚Äã took a neat leveling system and it is now awful.  They also made it so you only get one rescue at a time instead of the normal 4.  Bye bye...
A Google user : Good concept with lacking elements to it. I found myself grow bored after the first 30 mins and the controls seemed restricting. A good base to build up on.
Donnie Brasko : This game extremely needs‚Äã rpg element's, like character customisation with different items (not only stylized hat's). That would be awesome.
ahmad rilwanu : Best game ever!!!,but can you guys please make the weapon changing system,and also the clothes too olease make it happen we can draw weapon from gacha or from anything:)
talsapps : The last update was horrible... all the upgrade points that we've gathered are gone, what were you guys thinking?
Stefano Caridi : Level 3-6 is broken. I can't use the portal. Please fix
David Lewis : If you beg me for a rating, you get 1 star.
Babar Anggoro : Simple graphic, gameplay and control. Interesting game to play. Worth to try. Thank you creator
Dustin Kottke : later levels become very difficult to beat even if you deal with the puzzles perfectly p2w garbage.
Sal The 21st : The new free rewards is so bad.... before it was 4 prisons now its only 1....
Mary Lago : I downloaded and it kept crashing
PointGaming Online : Make a blue bros for my brother make it the same but with  a vilage icon so you can make a vilage

Eric Gromme : Really fun and different. A nice change from all the mobile "build your city" games.
adam enders : I really like the game but the only think I hate is when games only give us a certain amount of life's please change
Liam Hubbard : This game is really a lot of fun, i love trying to get full stars on all the stages and some of them are pretty challenging, good work playhard.lab

Jonnas Factora : Very addictive and certainly a good game
KAJE : Its really fun
Tracy M : :)
That Guy : Pretty fun
Brian Rehus : Ya good
Jessica Tavi : I was surprised how much I really love this game. The update has added a bit of confusion but I think it's to keep u guessing. Plus I like it better not having to collect repeats, instead you can exchange them for money that u can use for hats. Plus, the best part of getting mon eery instead is it makes it WAY easier to save up for the better prisons.  It's also hard to get any decent hats but it happens!!
Giorgos Koukoubagia : At first I thought it was a great game. Now that I see the devs improving it, it is getting even more awesome! Everyone should try it. It is not pay to win too.
Theeranont Chucharnchai : Very fun and creative game play. I love it.
thats guys : One of the funest  games I've played in a while
Andr√© Pinheiro : Fun and appealing. Nice mechanics
Insanity 576 : It's amazing but can you add customization to the camp

Byron Torres : Its  a quick  fun and addicting game
Jacqueline Hyewon Choi : Really good!
Alma Houston : So awesomeüòé
martyn adams : Great fun
Johan Endra : Good
Rohit Rajendran : The game was great until the new update limited the amount of free champs you can store (from 4 to 1) and entirely changed the levelling hero system (it was fine before why completely remove it and replace it with giving gokd instead?) .  The game was great but ruined by this greedy update.
Allyson C : Hero leveling system completely changed after this update, and without any warning. It was a fun game while it lasted, but this experience has left a bad impression unfortunately.
Joel : This game is so fun. It's a time waster, but it is worth it.
Paul Freeman : Easy game to pick up and play in short bursts to kill time
Derek Hunter : Different in a good way
J Himmell : New update wiped out all of my saved marks, increased the hero levels per player level (probably good, but makes all my existing heroes useless - so i have to rebuild without higher money from completing new levels), and changes the strong cage to only return 1 person (what is the point of that?). Not sure this is all bad for a new player, but sucks for anyone that already had a game started. I regret having spent money on the remove ads as i have no motivation to continue the current game.
weiloon guok : I prefer the older version where I can get 4 free heroes instead of 1. Now I only get 1 hero when I rescue a prison using gold. Even the prison that requires gem also reduces the heroes I get. I prefer the old version where I can upgrade my heroes by using the heroes in possession. It's great overall especially the part where we  check on our heroes atk and hp and stats. The dungeon also provides a longer gameplay. It's just too few heroes to get from prison now.
Daniel Stone : A one finger adventure that seems really polished.
a : Very smooth and amazing in every way possible
JE B.C. : Great game! Entertainig for so long!  Just dont know what some features are like the marks for upgrade and what is cp? How to see hp? What is advantage of 1 type of character over the other?  Maybe there is some help feature in game that I cant seem to find though. Otherwise that would be helpful. Thanks :)
Heezcawld Thenamelessone : Perfect. Satisfies a certain itch. I love this game, even the silly ways you can lose characters. Don't know why but I get a 'Time Bandits' (a movie from the early 80s) kinda vibe from this game. Stick with this formula and make a shooter next time around that'd be great
Mike Romero : This game is not good...... It's BEYOND GREAT!!! it's like Zelda with a Pirates twist. The controls are easy and fun to use. The concept keeps the player wanting to see and do more. Can't wait to see where this game will go in the future. Great game guys. Keep up the good work.
Alexandros Kouridakis : Overall, the game is great. The world is simple, yet perfect for the nature of the game. The same applies for the enemies. The concept of the game is really unique, and I love the way the game always manages to pose a challenge, without getting frustrating. However I have two complaints to make: One, the controls feel quite clunky, especially when it comes to double-tapping, which is not precise at all. And secondly, I have noticed that, many times, the game timer just freezes when I close the app, which means that lives and prisons do not regenerate. I would appreciate if those issues got fixed. EDIT: Giving credit where credit is due, I have to say the Redbros support team does its job very well!
Aron Holmberg : A way to cancel skills would be nice!  Quite a few "bugs" or just weird behaviour. Especially when it comes to clicking, sometimes they seem to move the exact opposite way. Seems like it happens if you click outside of their moveable area, like behind a wall. I would think it's obvious I want to move in that direction.
Doge egoD : i cant play this game keep black screen and stop working (lenovo a-7000,android ver 6.0 mashmello) ill rate 5 stars if i can play ;)    edit 5/20/2017 Atleast I can play. Here u go 5 stars ;)
Brennan Smith : It just...works! Everything about this game world, from the music to the classes to the rankings to the level designs. It's challenging but not frustrating, quick to learn but hard to master, and even the funny little traps make me laugh, not rage (but curse you, spiked walls!). All in all a solid game with much potential...  One suggestion, add more of a storyline...?   Amazing job.
JRome : I wasn't expecting this game to be as good as it is. Simple controls and stellar gameplay make this one of the most fun games I've played in a while.
martin bentley : Dungeons of dangerous foes good game play lots to do.movement is better than trying to get to grips with joystick or toggle stick.great game

BiggB 40488 : Its pretty good i love the little guys! If you make a button so you can just control 1 guy at a time id give it 5 stars

Jonathan Shih : Love it
Jeremy White : An amazing mix of retro and new school.  Easy to play but hard to master.  One thing that should be adjusted is....If I do a stage and complete 2 out of 3 stars I shouldn't have to get all 3 again I feel like we should just need to get the missing star.  Just one small idea.  Love the game it's a daily player for me now
Cody Knight : Awesome game, best I have on my phone! Can't wait to see what else you come out with. One small problem, maybe it's a glitch. Ch.2 lvl 6 it says to rescue 8 prisoners for a star, but the most you can't get is 6. Unless I'm missing sometging, but I've ran it 5 more times and can't seem to find more.
Kingslayer :3 idc why I got dis name : Lovely. Great graphics. Easy to control. I love how it's so strategic using different spells to your advantage such as Shield or Teleport. Great game overall, I couldn't rate gameplay 5 stars because if I do, it crashes. But this is a five STAR everything. Nice work HardPlay.Labs. I hope this inspires you (I wrote this to inspire you more and because me and my brother love Redbros).
Chrono XIII : I've just completed the first section can say that this is a very innovative and new game. The only problem I have found is that occasionally one coin won't be able to be picked up but it isn't very often and its a massive thing.
Das : This game has a very innovative and good concept that not all games might use and also that so many levels are there that u can technically play this game forever. So to the devs, keep up the good work and pump out hero classes and more levels, otherwise gg.
Kristian N : I've played the first chapter and the game looks great. Only problem so far is that there's not much of a challenge... Hopefully this will change as the game progresses.
Han Solo : Finally a game that takes advantage of the fact that smartphones' screens can respond interactively in response to multiple fingers input, not the usual one or two. Yes, multi-touch technology exists. Millions of dollars have been spent to develop it. But close to no developers really took advantage of that obvious potential usefulness...until PlayHard.Lab came up with the idea of exploiting this niche ;) It's very rare to find a game with some truly original ideas. They are too often just shameless copies of copies of copies. But Redbros brings something new to the store, finally. With a new kind of gameplay based on fingers slide and multi-touch. Levels are challenging and overall pretty well thought I have to say. Kill your enemies by wisely forming different positions/formations of your heroes, avoid traps by dividing your forces in multiple parts of the area, collect loots and upgrade your team. RedBros is a pretty good surprise so far :)
Patrick Juarez : Truly a game changer! I fell in love right away. Whatever your team is doing, they're doing it well!
Andrey Ibragimov : omg why no one can do games with THIS AWESOME GAMEPLAY???üòÉ I LOVE IT!!! If you will make more games like this, tell me.
Burak Baƒüdatlƒ± : This is such a good mobile game. I highly recommend it. I wish the Facebook button wouldn't load Facebook all of a sudden, I wasn't expecting that but it's a minor thing. Download, install, play now. You won't regret it.
_Ducky _ : Had alot more fun then i anticipated however getting characters is a little slow like new starting ones besides that small speed bump great game
TYRON HENDRICKSE : I  can't use any spells, game doesn't let me drag them further than the bottom of the screen they get stuck so can't finish level 3, I have tried to drag and drop it doesn't work the spells get stuck at the bottom of the screen while dragging and drop there so it never gets to the point it's needed
Zulhilmi Reduan : Love the creator as his not greedy and this game ideas is awesome. Hope for more level coming up next and of course new troops too
G Scheliga : Fun blend of RPG party-building and action-based gameplay that makes good use of the mobile touchscreen interface. Would benefit from character customization (equipment, skills, etc.), but otherwise well done.
Prashant : Not working on LineageOS 14.1 (android 7.1.2), just shows a black screen.
Antti Koivunen : Good game just keep making new characters and levels and updating I recommend it to anyone who likes Zelda type of games
General LDB : I like the game i have a small phone it gets hard to some times move a large group around lol nothing wrong with the app though really did love it
Nori MANAR : Very fun game, the controls, really easy to use, are a little bit tricky when you are around trap, especially when you have a lot of soldiers, but that is what make traps traps

Moses Setiady : a very cute and addictive game! totally worth it! i only hope there are some easier methods for us to gain free diamonds. overall, this game is perfect!

humphrey bogarden : I didnt like the rubber band gaga, basically when u buy gacha jail cells at the start and get a bunch of characters their completely useless when u level up, the gaga power increases, it's rubber band ui power model, each level up you gain u need to start all over and build or buy new characters.  One this wasn't warned not explained, so I'm very unhappy, two it's immoral.  Keep the gacha consistent the same...
Yanling : Why do you need permission to make and manage calls????? I'm using Samsung Note 4 Update: okay thank you for the response. Will be glad to make a small donation towards whatever project you're working on.
devon stern : Cute and creative puts a good twist on the ragtag army leader idea as well not to mention easy controls a serious must for any mobile game

ÎÉêÏïÑ : When i saw this in youtube i wanted to do it so much!! I love it!^^
ÏöîÏ†ïÏïåÎèô : Í∏∞Ïò§Ï∞å
Melanie Seiberlich : I love it, but please fix the bugs. last level of 13 can't get to the 
secret places if your screen doesn't show them... or only a couple people 
go, then you have to sacrifice the rest to get there, and then your stuck. 
also the tunnels on a lot of levels, half your people go in, and it's a 
back and forth loop.
mike ohair : It's like they forget it's a touch screen game.  I deleted after stage 3 level 2.1.  On top of that the random item system random unit system and lack of control with so many units in the dungeons.  It's just a poor concept for the platform and made worse by lottery system.  Needs to figure out if they want rpg, puzzle or first person and focus it.  Also why not get items and people by playing instead of gambling.
Urnedis Ungas : Ive been looking for a game like this for a long time. Where you have troops with different classes and you make them fight in a chaos action war. Like final fantasy tactics only real time
Yash Gulati : Gameplay awesome. Loved the concept. Controls got annoying sometimes, i dunno how to make them better really. Got stuck on a level, killed the mood to play more. Will be back for more later. Till then adios!
A Google user : Uninstaller as  soon as I saw the coins / gems up top. So tired of games designed around pay2win
Penpen Vader : I absolutely LOVE this game!!! The characters were cute and even my secret 
pet! The only problem that I've encountered were the controls since it was 
acting up a bit but the overall amazingness of the game covers it
Tystick Gaming : I haven't played this yet but the reviews are the best I seen in a while you almost replie to every comment even the bad ones trying to figure out how to make your game even better than it is.  Keep up the good work!!!!
dale jorillo : Had a lot of fun playing this game. The trap parts lets you think of other possibilities to defeat the opponents. This game is a must try.
A Google user : Nice Game PlayHard! Im looking foward to have multiplayer and dailies reward! Multiplayer : A Random map that one player control 2 Heroes only.. The multiplayer game can only 5 person meaning 10 Heroes maximum in the game.. Keep up the Goodwork PlayHard.Lab
Huck Trail : Very lame. There's no description of the items. The control is just terrible add a joystick and it might be better
Rafael Carrera : I always enjoy coming across a fun game that is different from the masses. Only tech problem I experienced was my units realigning different than how I swiped.
Francesco Perego : A wonderful game ruined by a stupid energy system. Just let the f**** 
players enjoy your game and add a premium via iap!
Jes√∫s : Really annoying tutorial. The game is fun but ive unnistalled it.
FusionPlayz -Minecraft pe : Very well prepared ands its more fun.  I have been finding a game.  Because all games are boring but this one is great
suman ghosh : Great game but 1 problem..its seems that ive caught a bug where i cannot 
see of my men's troops faces and enemy faces ...so plz solved it:)
Tomer Honen : Bloated with ads, some launch without warning, right after you've already watched an ad. Gameplay is alright but the whole experience leaves a bad taste.
Pachuau Thinchhia : Tooooo bad app. I download so many times but when i gonna play they olways kick me out . This not is ma game.
Sahil Pitale : Annoying coin sound and forceful tutorial which you can't skip or click through made me uninstall this game.
A Google user : Daily rewards doesn't seem to be working fine. It shows added 120 gems, but ~80 are shown and actually added. Please fix this.
Last Hope : Was ok for a little while till they restricted the option to watch videos for prison breaks, gold and exp boosts.
NILESH SHARMA : Bhavya SHARMA THE BEST OF THE CROWN ESTATE IS THERE ANY OTHER USE OF THIS MESSAGE WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU. I HAVE A LOOK AT THE O2 ARENA. I HAVE A LOOK AT THE O2 ARENA. I HAVE A LOOK AT THE O2 ARENA. I HAVE A LOOK AT THE O2 ARENA. THE MAY, AT THIS STAGE, BUT I THINK THE BEST OF LUCK FOR THERE FIRST,
Ilya Petrov : Tutorial stages made me question whether I have down syndrome or not...  This app is not my cup of tea I suppose
dedek rayyan : i like when its goin challenging cuz its make me more thinkin of how to survive from this place to the other places and its awesome that have a tiny people in there,they always looks so cuteüíò
xxDESENTxx : I can't even play it. I boot it up and it stays on a blank white screen. I re-uninstalled & restarted my tablet. Same problem. I wanna play it tho!!!
Anthony Nichols : Timers suck. This game is probably worth $5. But it's filled with timers and micro transactions making it not worth playing.
Lisa Samuels : I hate it be cause every time I play is or download it does dot work!!!z :-\ hateeeee!!! :-[:'(
XanthraX : Really good game...i downloaded and played it for 6 hrs straight (hadn't played before) i say again... massively addictive game...Two thumbs up..
Highpoint Lanky : Hated the game, deleted it, now after I uninstalled it, it started tweeting from my account. Don't bother
David : It's invasive. Pay to win. Lots of adverts and offline notifications even when you're not playing.
Soon : My account is gone... after I click the clear date button. They should have a better save system
Chandan Kumar : Hugger to go through my mind if it doesn't work then we are looking at this is not working in this thread for you are in town on Monday at all of them and Friday and Friday at all and it will send it is very easy as you have received an issue I can you give us some days facebook to do the work for us on our end the best time I will try the best time of reading it has taken to get this message in a different than you for a couple weeks of this communication and interpersonal to go with you in person in your area
Caroline Pollard : Downloaded it on android tablet and it never worked!Reinstalled 5times.Still didn't work.
Yash Ferwani : The game doesn't work its loading gets stuck at 69% üò†üò§
Budi Wibowo : The premise is good, but it fell short for me. Control is easy but hard to master. Overall, it's average to me.
Akicia Avila : It looked boring but i decided to install it and now i play it everyday
Dark V1rus_exe : Way too laggey! Don't get unless your looking for lag!
Sidhant Varshney : The thing is after certain level you'll start to feel bore and would uninstall it.The gameplay was unique no doubt about it.
DD Unlimited : I don't know why you give 2 or 3 stars .
