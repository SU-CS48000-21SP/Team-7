alyodhri pradana : mantap
idan reich : gg
ruslan zot : funny
ashiqur rahman mallik : getting ready to an important valuable fight of life while i find this..you are helping me so far.. just wishing that you wont make me grind too much nor my wallet so i can say that i like you (just chapter 1) and you deserve single player awesome story based gameplay with more sequels; new adventures/class/ventures timeline. i see portal puss*bilities along with two thousands more with you. then again, you are mobile and free and am poor but hopefully wise...awesome so far
ardamar : i'm loving how hard it is. not a simple game and the controls are spot on. just rather confused if the items do anything or are pure cosmetic.
aamir bilvani : great diablo like arpg, optimized for the mobile. only issue i sometimes have is during a fight with a switch nearby, i end up touching the switch instead of the enemy... otherwise a fantastic game.
jakub parzychowski : very nice casual game. gameplay is enjoyable and controls intuitive. cute graphics. does not force you to pay for anything and bonuses for watching ads are adequate. all in all a goo little game to kill time.
dan harvey ong : superb game! bought anti-ad and some pirate chests to support the devs! good job!
zabi g : game is fun, nicely-crafted, but the controls leave you desiring for better.
tim b : lots of fun! zeldaesque for sure.
bong francisco : love it!!!
rares lisovschi : thank you.
mr. shelby : i like it
avid wolf : thank you for using actual gameplay footage in the video preview. now i actually know i want to play it right off the bat!
yobjj 321 : this game is good for killing time
simone db : the game is very easy
cluckadoodle toons : well made game. every level seems different and not repetitive. some of the controls can be a bit annoying but overall it's fun.
anshuman anand : having a lot of fun, addicting,good for spending spare time
matt griffiths : this is a great game. easy to pick up for short 5-10 minute sessions, or just keep going and play for hours. iaps exist, but i haven't yet felt you need them to progress which is good. i purchased remove ads to support the developer. one thing i will say, the cost of cosmetics could get really expensive. maybe it should only increase in price when you get a new item instead of every draw?
mahmoud fath : it's a great game. i would give 5 stars but controlling is very bad
patrick wong : pretty fun game. the progression is at a good pace and the graphics are cute. i also like the multi-touch to split group.
jonathan willis : the game itself seems simple enough but some of the adverts are a problem. like final fantasy advert, there is no close button, you are forced to close and reopen the game to get back in.
syakirin mohamad : love everything about the game! the only thing that i want in the next update is, can you make so that we can interact with the heroes at the main screen? i love to see they're jumping around but sadly i cannot do anything with them.
a google user : not a bad little game! if you're a d and d fan! new gamers probably won't like this game! if you grew up on atari and intellivision! it's perfect!
pomagrenade : i'm not bluffing but this is probably the most fun i've had playing a game ever if u don't download ur missing out on a lot of fun!
abhishek singh chauhan : a totally addictive game.if you are bored because of old games then give it a try.you'll not be bored
andre candido : addicting! this is what i call a unique and smart game. there's nothing like this on the store!

tammy seiter : john cena:-) :-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-):-)
andrew rickard : i think the tutorial level design is good enough, you don't need to hold my hand for me to figure it out. it makes the game feel even easier. let players discover the problem and solution, they will feel more rewarded in the end
joel davies : easily one of the best games on the play store. yes it gets difficult, but i've not spent a penny on gems. its made me rage quit several times, but i can't stay away for too long.. incredible game.
ollie r : gets difficult quickly, i.e. they want you to pay money for gems for revivals quickly. unless you endlessly grind the boring and repetitive dungeon.
jesko k : very innovative controls. it's really f2p. since last update no experience from dungeons anymore. but fast reply from developers.
a google user : would have rather rated it 5 , but the live goes off too fast and take much time to get back, you should , add that the i st and 2nd stages be played without using life.
dominic anthony : fun i'm homeless and i can still get away for a good time thank you for such a great game
darkcogar : gets very difficult, kinda impossible but till then it's amazing

apekshit chandekar : i have a lots of fun in the game ..thank you so much for lovely game

a google user : super epic $$$$$$$$$$$$
derrick debenedetto : a simple and fun game. found this by accident and i never find good games. i would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a quick fun game with great replay value. don't have to play it for more than a few minutes but could pay it for a long time without being bored.
kings refuge : well first off. great game. now here comes the but. its great till you get to around lv 25. at this time you have at least 2 stats that are so rare its irratating. for example: triple shot for mage n archer, 20% hp for defensive players, sacrifice apon death heals party, 10% slow.
ali asgar jaffery : is it a game or what it is so much fun when we play it anytime i liked it thankyou for making the game.
michael greer : barring the usual free-to-play shenanigans, this is a very fun game. it has elements of many game types, including puzzle, action, role-playing, and strategy. the advertisements are not too numerous, allowing a good amount of fun to be had before they start rearing their ugly head. while i would much-prefer a game that is able to be outright purchased, i understand that this is the current state-of-affairs for mobile games. now, let's see if this game has legs...
omar m : great game i really enjoyed it. the graphics are cool and the game works smooth and fine. i liked the idea of fighting and solving puzzels it is really entertaining
a google user : this is a great time killer. fun little game, not much brain power required. very good game.

marquis mazyck : after awhile, it's not even about just fighting anymore. mostly dodging traps and solving puzzles.
joshua goodenough : so far so good. very cool and original concept. quite a few ads but at least they offer exp or money
patrick hodgson : this game crashed my phone 5 times and i still haven't been able to play it do not get
east paw : i really liked it at first, but after a certain point it becomes a chore to try and improve your party. the devs are pretty cool though and respond quickly to bug reports.
makalani the damskii : its a cool game. doesn't require a big commitment of your time. stages are not too long. i recommend this game for the line standers, passengers, lazy job, etc. great game devs.
h man : could not get past the touch screen at first, but i reinstalled and it's all good now.
austin hennequant : i've only played the game for a few days so i don't know about the long run, but this game definitely is an attention grabber
tridip r. hazarika : fun, unique and rewarding hero-collecting/strategy game. the in-game rewards are generous and there are no paywalls. definitely a 5 star game.
paulo barbosa : i think if you give reward its more likely that the person will rate it :)
weston fantz : simple, and engaging game that you can play anywhere without data. what can i say. its perfect
steyn westbeek : awesome and super amusing game. funky and appealing graphics. really gets you emerged in a simple fashion.

umimnm jsrfdc : it's a good game grate graphics and very nice control's this game is so fun
joshua beasley : awesome tap button rpg. i have enjoyed thus far.
test prime : i always wanted a strategy game on the phone, this is a real time, very basic strategy game with puzzle elements
jason k : a great concept but it doesn't use the formation mechanic nearly enough.
dubom moyong : great game but too many ads.... like to play some more games like this
ferryanto tjong : i love the concept of the gameplay, please make games like this more often
a google user : woah! this game is really cool! and bro can you make the health bars visible at all time? that would be nice :)

c geoffrey gaming & more : hi, wanted to do a nrw review. i am loving what the dev or devs did to this recently. i'm not sure when an update was done but it turned out cool. you can spin ( using in game coins from enemies) to get stuff you can equip & there's some new thing that makes you more "intimate" with other characters in your party although i'm not sure what happens when you max this out yet. only thing i miss is getting the "marks" of repeat heroes so you can level up your exusting characters but it seems you can just level up anyway by playing long enough. i do also like the fact you can now "sell off" crappier/ lower level guys for in game coins that you can "spend" for stuff like prisons
kevin sayers : fun game, terrible tutorial. no where do they tell you about the cp, attack, health, and how you should put together a team utilizing these different stats. edit: the new update made the game terrible. they took a neat leveling system and it is now awful. they also made it so you only get one rescue at a time instead of the normal 4. bye bye...
a google user : good concept with lacking elements to it. i found myself grow bored after the first 30 mins and the controls seemed restricting. a good base to build up on.
dustin kottke : later levels become very difficult to beat even if you deal with the puzzles perfectly p2w garbage.
donnie brasko : this game extremely needs rpg element's, like character customisation with different items (not only stylized hat's). that would be awesome.
david lewis : if you beg me for a rating, you get 1 star.
anand nicolai : amazing game. absolutely loved the controls, battles and graphics!

ika prasetio : love the graphic! very smooth control and overall clever design.
talsapps : the last update was horrible... all the upgrade points that we've gathered are gone, what were you guys thinking?

stefano caridi : level 3-6 is broken. i can't use the portal. please fix
janus : awesome game, simple and fun!
sal the 21st : the new free rewards is so bad.... before it was 4 prisons now its only 1....

liam hubbard : this game is really a lot of fun, i love trying to get full stars on all the stages and some of them are pretty challenging, good work playhard.lab
adam enders : i really like the game but the only think i hate is when games only give us a certain amount of life's please change
befizzy : i think its pretty fun and no stamina bar if you do a dungeon
eric gromme : really fun and different. a nice change from all the mobile "build your city" games.
huzaifa dholkawala : very cute, but things are really small, a bit of close up at times would be great

irm sav : simple but addicting
that guy : pretty fun
brian rehus : ya good
tracy m : :)
jessica tavi : i was surprised how much i really love this game. the update has added a bit of confusion but i think it's to keep u guessing. plus i like it better not having to collect repeats, instead you can exchange them for money that u can use for hats. plus, the best part of getting mon eery instead is it makes it way easier to save up for the better prisons. it's also hard to get any decent hats but it happens!!
giorgos koukoubagia : at first i thought it was a great game. now that i see the devs improving it, it is getting even more awesome! everyone should try it. it is not pay to win too.
theeranont chucharnchai : very fun and creative game play. i love it.
insanity 576 : it's amazing but can you add customization to the camp
kevin bartels : liked old version. uninstalled after update.

jacqueline hyewon choi : really good!
alma houston : so awesome
martyn adams : great fun
johan endra : good
rohit rajendran : the game was great until the new update limited the amount of free champs you can store (from 4 to 1) and entirely changed the levelling hero system (it was fine before why completely remove it and replace it with giving gokd instead?) . the game was great but ruined by this greedy update.
allyson c : hero leveling system completely changed after this update, and without any warning. it was a fun game while it lasted, but this experience has left a bad impression unfortunately.
joel : this game is so fun. it's a time waster, but it is worth it.
paul freeman : easy game to pick up and play in short bursts to kill time
derek hunter : different in a good way
weiloon guok : i prefer the older version where i can get 4 free heroes instead of 1. now i only get 1 hero when i rescue a prison using gold. even the prison that requires gem also reduces the heroes i get. i prefer the old version where i can upgrade my heroes by using the heroes in possession. it's great overall especially the part where we check on our heroes atk and hp and stats. the dungeon also provides a longer gameplay. it's just too few heroes to get from prison now.
j himmell : new update wiped out all of my saved marks, increased the hero levels per player level (probably good, but makes all my existing heroes useless - so i have to rebuild without higher money from completing new levels), and changes the strong cage to only return 1 person (what is the point of that?). not sure this is all bad for a new player, but sucks for anyone that already had a game started. i regret having spent money on the remove ads as i have no motivation to continue the current game.
daniel stone : a one finger adventure that seems really polished.
a : very smooth and amazing in every way possible
heezcawld thenamelessone : perfect. satisfies a certain itch. i love this game, even the silly ways you can lose characters. don't know why but i get a 'time bandits' (a movie from the early 80s) kinda vibe from this game. stick with this formula and make a shooter next time around that'd be great
alexandros kouridakis : overall, the game is great. the world is simple, yet perfect for the nature of the game. the same applies for the enemies. the concept of the game is really unique, and i love the way the game always manages to pose a challenge, without getting frustrating. however i have two complaints to make: one, the controls feel quite clunky, especially when it comes to double-tapping, which is not precise at all. and secondly, i have noticed that, many times, the game timer just freezes when i close the app, which means that lives and prisons do not regenerate. i would appreciate if those issues got fixed. edit: giving credit where credit is due, i have to say the redbros support team does its job very well!
je b.c. : great game! entertainig for so long! just dont know what some features are like the marks for upgrade and what is cp? how to see hp? what is advantage of 1 type of character over the other? maybe there is some help feature in game that i cant seem to find though. otherwise that would be helpful. thanks :)
aron holmberg : a way to cancel skills would be nice! quite a few "bugs" or just weird behaviour. especially when it comes to clicking, sometimes they seem to move the exact opposite way. seems like it happens if you click outside of their moveable area, like behind a wall. i would think it's obvious i want to move in that direction.
t. alex davis : great dungeon gameplay, original and intuitive controls, smooth progression, no need to spend $ unless you want to. had a bug issue and the devs were great to work with!
anish karthik : lost all my saved progress after update....i've made many achievements through game .. but still not able to get back where i left
robert diana : overall a really good game with good controls. i like that while being difficult at times it is still doable
efre mendez : recockulous difficulty spike, can only watch one video for free character per cool down instead of a few characters per cooldown.
marcos garcia : very funny and easy to play. sometimes it do not catch the taps and need to tap twice... but its ok
edpc chattan : great rpg + tactical game. if not the best so far.
jrome : i wasn't expecting this game to be as good as it is. simple controls and stellar gameplay make this one of the most fun games i've played in a while.
moses lazaro : it's really great and fun just have trouble getting some of the characters to move at once.
martin bentley : dungeons of dangerous foes good game play lots to do.movement is better than trying to get to grips with joystick or toggle stick.great game
abidur rahman : let's just say this is one of the few games i don't mind waiting for the lives to refill.
aditya kumar : i m stuck in 2nd chapter level one plz guide me any one,i can't go any further
brennan smith : it just...works! everything about this game world, from the music to the classes to the rankings to the level designs. it's challenging but not frustrating, quick to learn but hard to master, and even the funny little traps make me laugh, not rage (but curse you, spiked walls!). all in all a solid game with much potential... one suggestion, add more of a storyline...? amazing job.
the shocker 2017 : wow if there was a little update that you could make that brings the people you save then this will be probably my most favorite game! :d
doge egod : i cant play this game keep black screen and stop working (lenovo a-7000,android ver 6.0 mashmello) ill rate 5 stars if i can play ;) edit 5/20/2017 atleast i can play. here u go 5 stars ;)
aaron darrell-edwardes : the app keeps disengaging from game playing resets back to phone home screen other apps and games don't do it please fix this bug thanks great game but needs improvements

mike romero : this game is not good...... it's beyond great!!! it's like zelda with a pirates twist. the controls are easy and fun to use. the concept keeps the player wanting to see and do more. can't wait to see where this game will go in the future. great game guys. keep up the good work.

jeremy white : an amazing mix of retro and new school. easy to play but hard to master. one thing that should be adjusted is....if i do a stage and complete 2 out of 3 stars i shouldn't have to get all 3 again i feel like we should just need to get the missing star. just one small idea. love the game it's a daily player for me now
kingslayer :3 idc why i got dis name : lovely. great graphics. easy to control. i love how it's so strategic using different spells to your advantage such as shield or teleport. great game overall, i couldn't rate gameplay 5 stars because if i do, it crashes. but this is a five star everything. nice work hardplay.labs. i hope this inspires you (i wrote this to inspire you more and because me and my brother love redbros).
cody knight : awesome game, best i have on my phone! can't wait to see what else you come out with. one small problem, maybe it's a glitch. ch.2 lvl 6 it says to rescue 8 prisoners for a star, but the most you can't get is 6. unless i'm missing sometging, but i've ran it 5 more times and can't seem to find more.
han solo : finally a game that takes advantage of the fact that smartphones' screens can respond interactively in response to multiple fingers input, not the usual one or two. yes, multi-touch technology exists. millions of dollars have been spent to develop it. but close to no developers really took advantage of that obvious potential usefulness...until playhard.lab came up with the idea of exploiting this niche ;) it's very rare to find a game with some truly original ideas. they are too often just shameless copies of copies of copies. but redbros brings something new to the store, finally. with a new kind of gameplay based on fingers slide and multi-touch. levels are challenging and overall pretty well thought i have to say. kill your enemies by wisely forming different positions/formations of your heroes, avoid traps by dividing your forces in multiple parts of the area, collect loots and upgrade your team. redbros is a pretty good surprise so far :)
chrono xiii : i've just completed the first section can say that this is a very innovative and new game. the only problem i have found is that occasionally one coin won't be able to be picked up but it isn't very often and its a massive thing.
kristian n : i've played the first chapter and the game looks great. only problem so far is that there's not much of a challenge... hopefully this will change as the game progresses.
joseph wilson : fantastic. i have put off downloading because it looked chibi, but it's awesome.
tyron hendrickse : i can't use any spells, game doesn't let me drag them further than the bottom of the screen they get stuck so can't finish level 3, i have tried to drag and drop it doesn't work the spells get stuck at the bottom of the screen while dragging and drop there so it never gets to the point it's needed
zulhilmi reduan : love the creator as his not greedy and this game ideas is awesome. hope for more level coming up next and of course new troops too
zen mastiff : updated review. this game is awesome! well done. have uninstalled others and this has become my go to time killer. a must have.
nori manar : very fun game, the controls, really easy to use, are a little bit tricky when you are around trap, especially when you have a lot of soldiers, but that is what make traps traps
das : this game has a very innovative and good concept that not all games might use and also that so many levels are there that u can technically play this game forever. so to the devs, keep up the good work and pump out hero classes and more levels, otherwise gg.
patrick juarez : truly a game changer! i fell in love right away. whatever your team is doing, they're doing it well!
g scheliga : fun blend of rpg party-building and action-based gameplay that makes good use of the mobile touchscreen interface. would benefit from character customization (equipment, skills, etc.), but otherwise well done.
aniket shah : one of the best games i've played in a while. easy controls, fun challenges. love it.
moses setiady : a very cute and addictive game! totally worth it! i only hope there are some easier methods for us to gain free diamonds. overall, this game is perfect!

kory detwiler : it's working now, not too shabby of a game. only played about 10 min though. good job guys.

brendonedwards83 : loved the game till it wouldn't start up today for no reason. fix this and i'll change the review
burak bagdatl : this is such a good mobile game. i highly recommend it. i wish the facebook button wouldn't load facebook all of a sudden, i wasn't expecting that but it's a minor thing. download, install, play now. you won't regret it.
rain clouds : it's a really cute, fun and innovative game~ glad there are so many levels too

humphrey bogarden : i didnt like the rubber band gaga, basically when u buy gacha jail cells at the start and get a bunch of characters their completely useless when u level up, the gaga power increases, it's rubber band ui power model, each level up you gain u need to start all over and build or buy new characters. one this wasn't warned not explained, so i'm very unhappy, two it's immoral. keep the gacha consistent the same...

 : when i saw this in youtube i wanted to do it so much!! i love it!^^
 : 
mike ohair : it's like they forget it's a touch screen game. i deleted after stage 3 level 2.1. on top of that the random item system random unit system and lack of control with so many units in the dungeons. it's just a poor concept for the platform and made worse by lottery system. needs to figure out if they want rpg, puzzle or first person and focus it. also why not get items and people by playing instead of gambling.
melanie seiberlich : i love it, but please fix the bugs. last level of 13 can't get to the
secret places if your screen doesn't show them... or only a couple people
go, then you have to sacrifice the rest to get there, and then your stuck.
also the tunnels on a lot of levels, half your people go in, and it's a
back and forth loop.
fusionplayz -minecraft pe : very well prepared ands its more fun. i have been finding a game. because all games are boring but this one is great
pachuau thinchhia : tooooo bad app. i download so many times but when i gonna play they olways kick me out . this not is ma game.

anthony nichols : timers suck. this game is probably worth $5. but it's filled with timers and micro transactions making it not worth playing.

dale jorillo : had a lot of fun playing this game. the trap parts lets you think of other possibilities to defeat the opponents. this game is a must try.
