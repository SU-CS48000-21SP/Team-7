 i think this game is fun and enjoyable for most people like me  but maybe not for some people. i really like the game because of the funny jello-like appearance of the characters. i also enjoy the fact that there a a wide variety of characters and maps,1
 great glitchy game! fun as long as you believe it's multiplayer.... oh and hey the timer to open level 3 resets itself for me making it impossible to progress further... not much to say except it sucks !,0
 it's really a great game. there are a lot of games that the creators list made for pocket money  but this game really had some thought put into it. great physics  slightly addicting  love it.,1
 super fun! and no i was not paid to say this lol. this game is great. it is a little difficult to progress to different levels because of the amount of stars needed  but that just makes it a challenging game! i love it,1
 i think watching an ad to use the shotgun is a bit too much and that you can't go back levels but an overall fun game. thank you for responding. sounds promising.,0
 editing my first review...still five stars. addicting. great time killer. ive been a gamer sice videogames were only in arcades  and the console t.v. game was pong. trust me when i say  nice game. fun to play. easy controls  graphics are great. sound effects  too. i recommend this game to everyone. 5 stars.,1
 this game is funny  silly  and enjoyable. the animation style is cool and different. one thing is that it's hard to know where your shot is going. but thats all everything else is cool.,1
 game would be worth it if it had real pvp  instead of pve falsely advertised as pvp because the ai is representative of another player's avatar. this means the gameplay is pretty hollow because everyround is against a calcluating ai that will eventually just aim lock you if you can't knock them out quick enough. the rng of the arena is just to cover up the fact every match is the same. this concept would be effective  if you were playing against an opponent in realtime.,0
 amazing game you guys are underrated and insane please make more games in the future.,1
