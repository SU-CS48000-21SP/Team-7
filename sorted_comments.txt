 i think this game is fun and enjoyable for most people like me  but maybe not for some people. i really like the game because of the funny jello-like appearance of the characters. i also enjoy the fact that there a a wide variety of characters and maps,1
 great glitchy game! fun as long as you believe it's multiplayer.... oh and hey the timer to open level 3 resets itself for me making it impossible to progress further... not much to say except it sucks !,1
 it's really a great game. there are a lot of games that the creators list made for pocket money  but this game really had some thought put into it. great physics  slightly addicting  love it.,1
 super fun! and no i was not paid to say this lol. this game is great. it is a little difficult to progress to different levels because of the amount of stars needed  but that just makes it a challenging game! i love it,1
