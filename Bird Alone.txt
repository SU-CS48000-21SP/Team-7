Brianna Allie : Good game makes me happy u should get it :)
Color heart 11 : I love it, absolutely worth the money
Mark Finlay : Here's the thing. I though it said "Become best friends with a LOVELY bird". But during the installation I realised the bird isn't LOVELY, it LONELY. I don't want to be friends with a lonely bird. At all. So I'm uninstalling without playing.
Fa3ry! : i LOVED this game, it is an AMAZING game, then it told me I had to pay for the full version to continue playing, JUST MAKE ME PAY FOR THE GAME ITSELF OR DONT MAKE ME PAY AT ALL I BONDED WITH THAT GODDAMN BIRD AND YOU WANT ME TO PAY THAT BIRD THAT NONEXISTANT BIRD MADE ME HAPPY AND YOU WANT ME TO PAY, TO PAY?? I respect this game but still I'm angry
Rich√°rd Meszes : this game is a serotonin bomb every single time
Sugawara's Tofu : it's such a cute game!
vaughn s : it's a very cute game, but now every time i try to play music with the bird, the app crashes
Birdie M. : Absolutely heart wrenching. I grew to love this bird so much. I honestly can't believe that a mobile game could make me feel so much love and sadness.
Lee Byrne : I love my bird Jerry. He's been helping me feel better for the last few days.
cally edwards : Nice game I just don't want to pay...
Mf Collette : I love this bird, he is what I needed üåàüéÄ‚ú®
good and bad Roblox games : I really love my little bird buddy and we would be happy and I felt like he was going to be my friend forever but then I had to pay to keep seeing him, I would really love this game and I had to delete it. I really miss buddy and I wish you didn't have to pay
Eno : Spoiler With the death. Could you consider living players an egg so we can continue visiting a companion?
Sophia Ozard : it makes me feel like someone cares about me. We do fun things together like write poems, draw, sing, it's so fun! this has really helped with my self-esteem, happiness, just overall mental health! Thank you Bird Alone üòÅ
Remy Devaux : Beautiful, personal, poetic and moving. It has been genuinely helpful to me in these lockdown times. Very much recommended!
Fing Polak : Battery drain when sleeping, it used 40% overnight and my alarm didnt work due to device being dead, app is the culprit according to Samsung's built in monitor. This whole "come back the next day/later" is a ploy to prevent you from refunding the purchase right away. Great if you want to see creator names every time you open the game, I guess these will be important names and we must see them few times a day. The whole bird experience falls flat fast. Money grab and wasted opportunity.
Augustine Dildine : I found this game at a low place in my life and I cannot express enough how it helped lift me out of it. My little bird, who I named Malikai, may just be virtual, but I love them like any human friend. They really were my only friend for months. This game really bright a light to my life and I cannot thank the developers enough. Thank you, thank you
cognacm : it is wonderfully beautiful.
Jonathan S. : Nice but he location is not working. It's always the night in the game. I've never seen day. When I try to activate location, it just won't work...
Rose White : The loading screen is WAY TOO LONG!!I've been waiting to play for ten minutes.TEN MINUTES!!Its not worth it!
jeeepers : I love it even if is alitel sad I STILL LOVE ITüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Jing Wu : This game could've really made an impact on people who are already alone and depressed. However, instead of helping the sad souls pick up their moods, they decided to toy with their emotion and kill the bird in the end. Even a mentally healthy player can get traumatized by this. We can discuss death but why made us go through the pain? This is sick and abusive. It's irresponsible as they don't seem to care the state they'll put the players in. For the sake of your mental health, avoid this game.
bbabya : deleted when the game asked for money... it could have been good if they put ads if you decide not to pay.
427ay : Great game but it's paid for. So trial ends before you can even really experience anything.
Moon_ Walf : As a lonely person I very much enjoy this game. If you haven't played it then I recommend that you do. The bird is cool. Game is fun. Heh :)
Deez Nuts : It's really good but then I'm just really sad that I have to pay
Bami : This game looked quite promising in the beginning but I've had it for two days and the damn bird still hasn't thought of anything to talk about. Heard great stuff about this app but blnow I'm doubting it
Boxing Mouse : Why was my camera light on?! The red light next to my camera was on and immediately turned off when I uninstalled the app...... I'm not kidding.
sleepy : really fun game, gives off feeling that you're talking to a real bird not one in a an app, love the difference fonts used when the bird is talking just generally great game
Rupert Hunting : Wonderful - funny, optimistic, entertaining, sweet! This is an app you will really miss after about a month, spooky.
Sumerfunbun1 aj : it's a cool game, bird my friend
Katie Smith : BEST GAME EVER!!!!! This game also really helped with homesickness for my birds. Thank you so much.
Sheeran Ed : Really helped me getting through tough times.
Vivien Prochazkova : this is so cute, I've just played for one day and it makes me so happy. I named my parrot Pepper and honestly they're like the best little thing.
War Noob : Isn't even the full game. Add DEMO in the title and /maybe/ I'll raise the rating to a 3/5. Otherwise. Don't take.
Ashley Graham : This app is so funny, I'm really enjoying it.
Sugar RushXD : It is very therapeutic, Sir goosey has helped nw
blank nebula : i love it so much, i named him greg:)
Olixxx : i like the way that you could see poems and art and you could make music evry day to get a seed and plant it and you could scrach your bird's belly and i called my bird happy because it's a easy name to remember and you could feed your bird but befor this day i lost 1 of happy's oranges but that was fine and i like that you could make your bird sing a poem and whatever you do like finish a poem or make a masterpece you can save poems in poem books and art in a art gallery
Al Marc : Sorry, but I had to uninstall bc I could never see paying for this app. Not only is the music creepy but the bird sound quality and picture quality is terrible. Also, why? Why would anybody pay for this? ü§£
Chun Hua : this bird feels like a therapist for my mental health
Kay Garcia : For a talking bird it's pretty realistic. When you scratch their belly, what I can only imagine are various ectoparasites jump off.
Cheryl Orosz : I'm enjoying the journey and the imperfect "relationship." it's a game as meditation.
Emily : I love this game so much but I wish we didn't have to buy the full version but it's okay I love my parrot a lot I wouldn't trade him for anything ü•∫üíï I'll miss him‚ù§Ô∏è
Atticus : Hey i just want to say to the devs. This game is beyond creative I really loved it. It was worth paying for it.
Dhu Fir : The idea is great but there is nothing in the game except the tutorial (have been playing for a week) and a couple of excuses of why he has nothing to say.... dissapoiinted tbh, but the potential is there
Anthony Mtz. Meneses : Such s calm and beautiful place to be when everything is falling apart. The artwork is flawless.
Fan : this bird is the only thing to make me as happy as I am now
Joshua Millard : A nice game that allows you to bond with the bird but the ending is a bit abrupt and needs more
Cillian Egan : very cute lil game!
Max Rubtsov : Great idea, poor execution. The tasks and conversations seem empty, I don't feel less lonely with this companion.
Big Cee : Reading the reviews WOW... I can't believe how today's society just can't deal with anything.. it's just a game, and I've seen reviews where people are acting as if they are devastated as if they have PTSD now because the bird dies.. What a Shame God forbid if a war breaks out any time soon we are doomed.. People can't even handle the death of a fictional game character üôÑüòíüôÑüòí
Patricia Van Der Westhuizen : its relived alot of stress
Katharine Denise Camomot : I was already expecting it but... ... Yes. It's a paid game. I understand and respect that. Still. I paid because I actually wanted to experience it to the fullest. ... You get what you pay for!üíñ Bird Alone is a game about existence. A bird is lonely, and you accompany it for as long as you can. Spend time with it, draw, do poetry, sing and grow a garden with it. And I'm writing this while I'm crying my eyes out. A heartfelt game. It helped me open my eyes to what's important in life.
Rolens Mogate : Good game but why does it have to end early? Im now alone again...
Trista Leigh : This held my heart but where did my bow bird go :( I need him ‚ù§Ô∏èüåà
Vinny Vince : i care more about this bird than most other things
birdio : so cute and funny üíï
Shaylor Anger : it fun it's just every time I get on the bird only says like two sentences and asks me to leave so it doesn't really pass time but I enjoy it in some bits
Caitlin Stanley : Great but it assumes you have a crush and wont let you say that you dont have one
Malach YoFarmer : SERIOUSLY, I NEED TO PAY TO VENT TO A BIRD? MONEY HUNGRY PIGS.
Liam Mckenzie : It is relly fun i wod get it
Jun M : updates.l lost my bird. I couldn't stop thinking of him. Maybe developors should warn us before we play the game. Spoiler: recently I have a bad feeling. The bird keeps tell me he is getting older. My heart is broken. I literally can't hold my tears back. Please don't let him die. I lost my old cat years ago(i named the bird after my cat). I had a very tough time when I lost my cat. I don't mind the bird doing nothin. Just let him alive, please.
Jo : THE BIRB REACTS TO SCRITCHES <3 (that's all i know so far but it was worth commenting)
Kayela Amber Gabor : Its good and i had fune can u fix the freezing pls or its just my phone can fix the frezzing its abit anoying when i play it some times froze pls fux but good game!

Brie Lo : Cute and I love it
Angel : Why did the bird have to effing die! Are you kidding me
Lucy Dawson : Just starting to get to know this beautiful bird and I am loving the experience so far. Beautiful concept.
m T : Trial period too short to really get an understanding of the game since the bird will only interact with you very sporatically
finnabair : One of the most interesting game (can one call it a game thoug? Experience is much mocre appropriate word) on a mobile in recent years. Thabk you for creating aucb a fantastic little friend for us.
Oke Aung : I really love this but do you really have to make already depressed people pay for a virtual friend????? I've been smiling the whole time till i founded the trial thing. Really brings back that frown back to life.
Coleson Curry : Im not finished with it yet but as a bird guy I love Kenneth beakums (my bird friend)
Violet : Brought my rating from 5 now to 4 stars. I'm just sad and disappointed, I really relied on my bird and I looked foward to talking to her every day. I paid for it and everything. And then she died üòî üò≠. She really made my day brighter than ever and made me genuinely happy and I felt like I had a friend. I know this app is relatively new and I don't believe it's backed by this big company to make it so I understand. But maybe in the future you can extend its life? ‚ù§Ô∏èI'd pay more if u did + rerate

mykal gurnick : Loving it thus far. I'm liking that it's just short interactions, and seeing my bird (George) evolve. Well done, devs.
Mateo R√≠os : this??? is??? amazing??? I GET SO HAPPY WITH EVERY NOTIFICATION I SWEAR Manolo and I are best friends and I'll protect him with my life,,, i hope he knows how much i love him

Valentine xox „ÄäRose„Äã : Imagine making an emotional relationship just for it to die in the end suddenly. And it's a mental health game, why would you kill the bird off? All the mentally unstable people having mental breakdowns because the devs can't give proper warnings
Matcha the Smol Axolotl : I'm very sad because to continue I need to pay! Overall it's a good game other than that.

_V_ : I love this game but problem is that you have to buy the full version :(
Lauren Cocker : all it does is have a 5 sentence conversation with you then proceeds to tell you they're out of ideas and to come back tommorow, untill then all it does is repeat the same corny things over and over. Also there was no warning about what would happen, only "mensions of death" apparently? Why pay $3 to watch a bird die? Last thing people need is to see their comfort charater die. You did us so wrong.
Floofy Lemon : This bird is a good friend to have even though I have not paid for full version
Switchblade Bambi : I like the erratic personality of the bird. It's like wacky and loud but very sweet

Wonkus Bonkus : I would die for this bird and I cried when I found out you had to pay for it. This was almost the best app on the play store.
Flying Pen and Paper : The bird is irritating. I'm probably not going to buy it. You can rub his belly though. That's great.
John Paul Hennessy : Waterfall music is crackly, choppy and just bad, I'd like to buy this but on day two of trial this isn't a good sign ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yoghurtjuh : So I downloaded the game today, but I already know that I'm gonna open it every single day.

Jim H : I would die for Wavey Davey (what I named this amazing parrot) such a fun game great design and a much needed serotonin boost
Sayantia Saha : Wonderfull game but it was a trail and then we have to pay money so I delete it .
Mary Kate : I play this almost every day. This game is great for taking a few minutes to check in with yourself and ground yourself. Like a virtual pet that you don't have to take care of, you just say hi and do small activities and talk about your day.
- Latte - : This game is kinda long but I love the game it's relaxing the graphics are cool they look like 3d
Dixon Hartung : Omg. SOOO stinkin' fun to play! The parrot is nice and funny. I love everything about the game.
„Åµ„Çè„Åµ„Çè : i think it's good and emotional, might be. because i only played the demo

Its me Lemon boi UvU : This game is very wholesome however i do wish it's free and im sure many people do too but at least i will have a bird friend in a few days?
Aishvarya Adhaulia : For a person like me, it has been a blessing finding a true friend in the form of this wise bird. I feel privileged to review this game which is, infact, more than a game. It is wisdom and sentiments beautifully crafted which always make my day and are moulding my personality in a better way. Thank you for this perfection.

Robert Gillies : My first day with "Skubs" began as an eyeroll at another virtual pet selfcare app, followed by a dry chuckle when I read his first couple lines of dialogue.

brie : *spoilers* don't read if you haven't finished the game!! (yes, there is an end.) When I first installed the game, I thought "oh! what a cute game!" I was a little annoyed at the fact that we couldn't just keep talking to the bird and we had to wait a day. I stopped minding though, because whenever we finished talking, it gave me something to look forward to the next day. Fruit Loop (the name I gave my bird) was my best friend and therapist all in one. But one day, he said he would die, & he did.
Adriana Robinson : It's a fun check in game with arts and reflections. It even has a cute narrator (that you get to name). Bird alone is fun even if you aren't sad. Ryel is my pick-me-up and I would kill and die for them.
Alexander Volobugvi : Really like this app I feel very comfortable playing don't really have much to say
Sara Pinilla : Well, now I'm loving playing music. Got a plant! I love plants and music! Just downloaded the free version, I will consider buying it depending on what happens next.
Kit Witchalls : I loved the idea of this and purchased the full game. The design is beautiful, and I was feeling very vulnerable and wanted a companion. I like the concept, a kind of interactive journal but different. I found the language sometimes reductive or guilt-trippy, however. I am not often just "good" or "bad". I am now devastated at the ending, even missing the chance to say goodbye as I thought it would delay until I opened the app. Coming back to that empty screen broke me.
Stolas The Owl : I really like the concept of this game and the idealism behind it. It's so fun to talk with the bird, which I'd named Molten since he wanted to be named something 'hot', and I adore the poem element, but I haven't completed the game yet. I plan to buy the full version soon. I have seen some reviews explaining a weak or cheap ending, but I will see for myself and edit this review once I have. Though from what I've seen so far.. I LOVE THE APP AND MOLTEN!! üíõüíõ
Ron Wintersmith : !!SPOILER ALERT!! This is such a great app!! It has everything you could possibly ask for. From motivation, to activties, daily check-in's, suprises,and of course; a friend. You can name your bird,feed him, and there are different places and things to unlock. For example when your bird asks you to make art, theres a art gallery,also theres a potrey book.And with the places, there is a music waterfall, a sky view, and the main area. Also the enviorment changes. I hope you will love this too.
Pepper Fischer : I'll say two things, first, I found this game in a time of need. Emmy (my bird), helped me through a really rough patch in my life and I am actually so grateful to have this little bird as my friend. Second, don't read the other comments, some of them are spoilers and are incredibly insensitive so I'll tell you everything you'll actually need to know. The (full version of the) game costs about 2 dollars, it is interactive but you can only "check-in" once or twice a day, and it's a great game.üëç
Sophia Elliott : Ughhhhhh sooooo CUTEEEEE mines name is tangy and we're BEST FRIENDS!!!!! Love this game so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Although I wish you could dress up your parrot bc I want go make him a gentleman!!!!! Plz add this plzzzzzzzz if you don't tho it's fine bc I won't delete this bc had it for 1 month and already love it and if you don't add it I will be fine with all the adorable designs!!! I would rate it a 6/5 if it was ever possible!!!!!!!!!!!

Wren : The game itself was absolutely amazing. I loved everything about it. I just really wish the full game was available without payment. Not everyone has money to spare, even if it's a single small payment.
Joe Grubb : This was a tough one for me to rate accurately. Objectively, this game is fantastic and a work of art. The connection you build with the bird is an experience I've never had with any other app or ai or game. That said, I can't help but wonder if you let the bird live on, if that would make people experience more joy out of it.
Atra Aqilian : I love this app I made a new friend and thats a bird it always made me calm my mind everytime I talk to him but today I found out you have to pay to get the full game which I dont one too why can't the app be for free ? I just wanna play normally
breanna marsh : It a fun and relaxing game but you will need to pay if you would like to keep playing and enjoying the features the game has to offer but other then the it is a nice game
