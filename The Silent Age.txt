elly brus : these are the kinds of games that deserve to be supported by your wallet. i would say it's equal value to seeing a good movie. very polished, clever writing, great concept and decent length for the money. the story kept me guessing with some great payoffs. the end is unexpected and satisfying - surprised i haven't come across the idea in other stories as it seems like an obvious one.
a google user : annoying protagonist and boring story. i love point and click games, puzzle
games, mystery games and had high hopes for this one. but the main
character is so weak and spineless and the gameplay so tedious that i
didn't care what happened to him. hence when i reached the point in the
game where it wanted 4 to continue, i declined. i had only played it to
the end of the first part out of sheer bloody mindedness because i like to
finish things lol.
tallcakes malone : really cool so far. love his responses to things when you try to use items in a ridiculous way. i do it on purpose sometimes just to see what he'll say. just got to stage 4 and enjoying it. it could be a little more exciting in terms of puzzles that could be solved, or a slight element of danger. i do like easy games because life is hard enough. but i feel like a little something is missing from this one. tbd.
najib aslam : i swear to god that i reaallllyyy lovee this game... it is very cool and addictive... to all that plays the game, i suggest that you should really really buy the second episode becausr it is very good story. just one thing, i deleted the game cuz i finished it but after i download it back recently my purchased episode 2 was gone. hope you can fix it
a google user : good game in the style of all those point and click adventures of years gone by. only done the first part and need to pay for second part, which is fine, but 4 seems a bit expensive as the game seems quite short. edit: having played the full game, although well made, with a good story, i found the ending a bit abrupt. i thought there was about to be more game left and no that was it final cut scene and end credits. i hope they produce a sequel or follow-up episodes.
chetan chaudhary : it has one of the best stories of the games that i have played till now. i liked the way we switch between past and present to find objects and open doors and stuff. it took me about 6 hours in total divided equally into 4 days to explore everything and tech the ambulance at the end of the first chapter. loved the cutscene after that as well. i haven't bought the next episode yet but i will definitely sooner or later.
karissa mercado : "demoted to 2 stars due to inaction to my complaint." i played this a year ago. now i got a new phone, got the game again and purchased the ep2 via load. had to remove it so i can install it in my tablet which it couldn't because no space, reinstalled it again on my phone and for some reason, i couldn't restore my purchase. please do something about this. i really liked your game and haven't even started ep2 yet.
felipe ribeiro : this game is very immersive, with good graphics and soundtrack, a great story, nice controls and good puzzles. the only defect is the short time of the subtitles. sometimes i could not read because the text disappeared too fast, so i needed to click again to continue reading. it seems something easy to fix. i recommend you to try the game, and if you like it, get the second part.
aidan p. : a lot of loving work was put into this game, and it is very apparant. the music and voices are excellent, the visuals are simply stellar, and the puzzles, while not too hard, are rewarding. the only reason i am not rating this 5 stars is because of the price. the first half of the game is free, while the second half is $5. i purchased it and enjoyed my time, but i think it is worth $2-$3 instead of $5. however, try the first half and see if you like it, there is nothing to lose.
matt anderson : i got frustrated after the first 10 minutes, and relied on a walkthru at least 6 separate times, just to reach the end. this has a cool story, and while i didn't like the characterization of the protagonist, that is just a personal preference for someone less "modern", but otherwise, the plot is cool. the art is amazing. if you're willing to pay for the next two chapters, this is amazing, you should download it right now. personally, i'm fine leaving it just here. but you should totally give this one a try
joshua kallen : it's a fun game. while you might end up not figuring out what comes next, the difficulty is just right. the graphics are amazing, too. it's very appropriate for the game. but i will be honest, the price for episode 2 is a bit steep for me. don't get me wrong, i would gladly pay for it. sadly, i do not have any source of income yet which is why i can't pay for the next episode yet. but, even so, i commend the developers for giving us a free portion of the game. i definitely recommend this game.
j.kalin tyler : old school adventure gamer, so i get bored easily. while the puzzles aren't too challenging, they aren't tedious, plus the story is phenomenal and extremely interesting. it actually kept me guessing and there wasn't a predictable ending. eerie and creepy. great sounds, visual, voice acting, etc. hoping for another installment :)
a google user : good but fairly easy. if you like storytelling games you'll like this. if you're looking for a challenge, note that this game is easier than escape the room games. and $5 does seem like a lot compared to similar games. also, there is no google games integration, so no save game. not sure if the game ever stops you from playing levels though.
heather : interesting storyline and cool graphics. i like that this game is challenging and makes you think about how to solve its puzzles. you do have to pay $5 for part ii but i think it is well worth it. i was engaged the entire time. the only downfall: i just wish the gameplay was longer! you can easily beat the entirety of this game in a few hours. still one of my favorite games that i've played.
travis nelson : 05/10/21- i revisited this game in it's entirety playing all the way through both episodes, and this game is one of the best. the story and plot is gripping, interesting, and keeps you engaged. i was a tad sad to finish it honestly. 10/10 absolutely loved this. 11/22/17- this game was once only a mobile and and now it's also on pc. but for being a little mobile game, this truly has a gripping story, i have such a high opinion of this game. it's amazing, i have loved every second of it. 10/10
keyo : great game. i really am enjoying it and am at the half-way point of episode 2. my only complaint is sound (it might just be my phone). whenever a text message or call comes through, when it ends, the sound on my game is now mute with no option to turn back on. i need to exit the app and reload in order to restore sound. really irritating. other than that, no other complaints.
lisa ebe : i found this an extraordinarily fun game that i would definitely recommend to others. great storyline, delightful sense of humor and nice graphics. would have been five stars, except: it seemed like every single puzzle involved tedious walking back and forth between distant rooms (was that just me?), and it made my phone run extremely hot (i couldn't even hold it sometimes). so owners of non-powerful phones, be wary. everyone else, don't hesitate to download.
snoot snoot : at first i wasn't sure it would be worth it to buy the second episode for 5 bucks but man it definitely was. it's a very cool concept and well executed. the controls add a now layer of complexity that make it fun. i wish i could spoil the end but all i can say is that i was very very satisfied. the developers made sure to keep it realistic with the times (the first episode takes place in the 1970's i believe) and it makes it very satisfying knowing it is realistic in how a disaster would play out. 10/10 would recommend. the only thing i might consider mentioning thats slightly negative is that there's no hint button. thinking it over, i get why there is none, but it gets frustrating at times, and ive had to look up a walkthrough a couple of times to find that i was missing something simple. so if youre not good at solving things with no help, consider a walkthrough. ;3
irene langholm : i loved this game. it's unique, it has got a capturing, mysterious atmosphere created by great graphics and mood music. and not least it has a brilliant story line. the walking back and forth between rooms could at times be a bit tedious, but the overall experience is five stars. make more!
simon whymark : really enjoyable, good quality, immersive story. i found the scenes to be a bit challenging, but by no means impossible. i really really wish i could justify 4 on the second episode, but given that it only took me a couple of hours to get through the first one, the price is a bit steep. these days a lot of multi-million dollar hollywood movies are available for less than that, and probably aren't much shorter!
tre : nice concept with the ability to go back and forth in time within the same scene. you collect tools and objects to solve puzzles. it does get a bit repetitive and i didn't even buy the next chapter. however the story is intriguing and i do want to find out what happens. graphics and design are impeccable! definitely worth trying
samantha hulass : this is an incredible game. i loved the first one but the second one is amazing. 4 is a steal for an immersive two-part adventure like this. the story line is well thought out and there are so many twists and turns in terms of the plot. and the dialogue and voices are great too. joe is such a hero!
valerie seet : 25 may 2017 i'm not good with words but i'm just gonna say that this game is tremendously enjoyable! the $6.00 purchase for episode 2 seems very worth it.. 6 may 2020 3 years on i have replayed the game and it was still as interesting as ever. this time i decided to buy the second episode and it did not disappoint!
laurence hurtado-read : a great game that i got instantly hooked on. the storyline is great, and the second episode, whilst expensive, is well worth it. if you consider that the fiver is for both parts, it's not that much. people complain about paying for this but the workmanship is amazing and well worth paying for. i agree with other reviews that i'd have liked more of an ending, or even an episode 3!
james silver : i love the smoothness of the gameplay. great details and a good story. i found part 1 of the game reasonably easy to complete. paying 4 to unlock part 2 won't happen anytime soon as it's too expensive. if the developer's add new parts & concepts to the story, included in the 4 spend. this would make a great game to buy. part 2 came out 2 years ago, are there going to be anymore parts or is this it?
dancing ostrich : one of, if not the, best mobile game i've ever played. just finished 2nd play through and loved it just as much. the humour is great and the story is epic in its scope. great twist at the end! better than broken sword etc and much more innovative. highly recommend.
mayara la'rae : it's so hard to find a good adventure/problem-solving game like this.
especially for apps right now that in my opinion are so basic. this game
was worth plying. it wasn't easy but what's the fun with no challenge? i'll
continue to search for good games like this. i respect those behind this
game, it shows they enjoyed making their work and i enjoyed playing it.
i'll be looking out for more from you guys ! ty -- oh, only thing. for some
reason if i got a text or anything, the sound in the game would shut off.
i'd have to shut it down and re-open it in order to get the sound back.
zeb mcclure : great fun, traditional adventure game. definitely worth the in app purchase. only reason i didnt give 5 stars is because there is a sound bug if a notification sound plays, all game audio is muted until the app is restarted, slightly annoying but the fun wasnt too affected. best adventure game app i have played to date.
julie wallis : i was having a lot of fun with this wonderful game but after finishing chapter 4 i was not able to progress without purchasing the full game. now don't get me wrong, i've no problem paying but i do get miffed when i download a game under the pretence of it being free when it is only a taster. had it been a full game it would have been 5 star, had it been advertised as a taster it would have been a 4 star but i don't like being conned and downloading a taster makes me feel conned.
dani d : this is a great point & click game that has that old school feel to it. the storyline was good and the puzzles were pretty easy. my only complaint, and the reason why i did not rate it 5 stars, is because i felt that for the $5 needed to purchase part 2 of this game, there was just not quite enough content or gameplay to justify the cost (maybe knock off a couple bucks...)!?! this is of course my own opinion, and if it comes right down to it, i would say that if you have the money to spare, you love point & click games, and you really enjoyed part 1 than you probably should purchase part 2 of this game! if nothing else, it could possibly add a few hours of enjoyment to your life! :-d
rachael burger : such a fun, addicting game, with great visuals, intriguing story (until the end), and intuitive controls. *spoiler* the major twist is actually the problem. with joe being patient zero, everything we have done thus far through the game is useless. it is not explained what changed, if anything, and thus makes no sense that there are people still alive in the 2000s.
samyuktha krishna : a big fan of this point and click adventure; love the graphics and story! a lot of folks are complaining about the steep price of the game. the first part is free, you pay for the second if you want to continue. imagine the amount of effort and time that goes into making a game with a well written story and pleasing graphics. i honestly felt the $5 is justified. please make more games like this!
matthew ellertson : great puzzle/point and click adventure! the storyline got me hooked instantly, and i picked up on what to do in a reasonable time. one thing though: the header image says episode 1 & episode 2. while yes it's in the game, you gotta pay $5 for it. would've been nice to know before downloading. and before i got really invested in this story...
amir nikouyee : i really liked this game. in my opinion, there's nothing wrong with the game. just one thing though. the second episode should be free and also, when i finished the first episode, i couldn't go back to the back. like, each time i tried to enter the app, there would just be a black screen. but that's probably just me.
d s : this game is absolutely worth the price. great story and art direction, casually challenging puzzles. if you rent sci-fi flicks, spend an evening playing through this game instead. i... i mean... a friend pirated it first and still had to come back and pay for it. it's that enjoyable!
matt huggins : it's a very well done game overall. nice throwback to some old point-and-click adventure games. good storyline too! i would have given 5 stars if it was a little cheaper; $5 is the most i've paid for a mobile game, and there's unfortunately no replayability.
james willis : was a great first game, then they had to ask for donations for episode 2 afterwards... fair enough. but now they're charging for episode 2 of a game that was already paid for by it's fans? that's cheap. edited to reply to developer's response: yes, i do think it's fair that some people can get it for free even after others have donated. that's the very definition of donation. it's not a donation if you can only get the product by donating. some visitors pay donations to free museums and art galleries. does that mean i should have to pay to get a ticket to see inside? no, because then it's not a donation, it's an entrance fee. if fans have to pay for episode 2, at least stop referring to it as donations, because that's clearly not what it is.
a google user : this gane is full of mystery and wonder. i really enjoyed playing it. the graphics are great and the storyline is very nice. it gets you to think and challenges you. the only bad thing is that the second epidode of the game costs money and i can't buy it even though i really wanted to.
xrnohporter stanmore : it may have simple graphics and controls but they give this game a certain style and charm. it has interesting puzzles that are not always easy. the story is engaging except for the ending which feels a little clumsy. all in all, well worth a look.
ramix nudles : interesting, but awkward. game play is a bit slow. if you miss something, you may wind up wandering about blindly. the idea of single use tools is inconceivable and frustrating. a katana, while awkward, world be handy to carry around for all sorts of uses. a pocket knife would have more uses. nope, i'm wrong. anything had only a single use, even if the object would normally not be a single-use object. use it once, and it disappears. i've been wandering around for a bit looking for something - i know not what.
aneesa d : its a well made game but you need to pay for the extra episode in order to really get into it. you get excited only to be let down! if your willing to spend 5$ on a game than this may be the game for you because it definitly seems good. but i just don't understand why they didnt just advertise it as 5$ to begin with.
lindsey mercuria : i really loved the game so i bought the full version. the only reason this
isn't getting five stars is because the full version seems shorter than the
free version. i finished the full version in a day, it was that damn easy.
for $5 i should have gotten more gameplay, not less than the free version.
also, the ending was kind of a let down considering the storyline was so
cool.
g3tsi ak : wow now that was definitely worth it. problem solving where you're required to alter things in the past to get what you need... great story, characters, and the game makes you think outside the box to solve situations. need more games like this. would definitely pay for another.
zerg kz : this game is brilliant it's actually fun bouncing back and forth in time messing with things to change the future. the ending i didn't see coming until the last 10 mins of play. very well done and i hope to see more similar games in the future
merrav g : i really like this game, but the title "episode one and two" is misleading!
only the first episode is free. it gets you into the story and then it's
really annoying to stop, not knowing what happened next. this game is in
the "free games" section at the play store, but it's not. not cool ppl!
don g : if you play puzzle adventure games like this one, you're familiar with how often they seem random. where you find objects, and how you use them often feel unrelated to the story. not here. two worlds are presented and tightly woven together for a superior game experience. throw in the top notch graphics, strong plot, good sense of humor and great voice acting ... what more could you want?!
kacee gamer : this game is just simply dope! i regret why didn't i downloaded this game in 2013 it's absoulutly is a facinating game the background theme and music is so creative and awesome. house on fire it is a generous request to you all to make second part,what happened with him in 2012.
barry kent : well, game is very nice, very good, simple, but fun. however, this is very,
very short game (i completed first half within one hour). simple and
veeeeery short... and 5 eur for probably another hour? much too much. if
devs would make few hours it would be too expensive anyway. take a look at
rusty lake gems and their prices. or don't starve games... i would watch
ads for this game, but 5eur is much too much for such very short and simple
game... maybe you do not realize that for most people 5 bucks is just too
much? most of android users are not living in us, uk or japan, you know?
android altus : it has great graphics and easy puzzles. humor is sorta decent. story has white threads. if you ever played old school lucas arts games like indiana johnes and the fate of atlantis for example and it being 10 out of 10 silent age is 5 at most.
nicole andre salgueiro : amazing graphics and the plot of the game...l love the suspense music , the mystery and of course the brain thinking puzzles!i like how each character seems like everyday people including the main character. although it is a pity we have to pay for the 2nd chapter (totally worth it)i still rate this game 5 stars because it is one of the best games i've played in a long time!!!!!
stephanie rose : i played the first episode which was great and i was really excited to see
what would happen in the second however i was left pretty disappointed. i
paid $5 and honestly it was pretty predictable, not really worth that
amount. i definitely wouldn't have paid for it. it is great visually and
the story was good but i'm left feeling unsatisfied.
yiorgos halkos : nice story, smart concept, but way too easy. i finished episode 1 in about an hour, without any puzzle giving me a hard time, so i must admit i'm reluctant to pay 5 euros for another hour or so of gameplay. nonetheless, i enjoyed it while it lasted :)
david thomas : good game but too short - after playing the first five levels, and feeling ok, it had me hooked enough to carry on and pay 4 for the rest of the game, was a bit disappointed that the the remaining paid section was only the same length - maybe a positive if you just play the free bit how much you actually get for free, but once you've paid for the full game you kind of expect that to be at least three times the length of the free demo. ending was really abrupt as well as if the designers were just tired and thought, ah that'll do, we've told a enough of a story and got our money now, game over!
paul brett : great little short puzzle game- no irritating obscure puzzles. looks great too. happy to pay 4 for several hours of fun. you'd expect to pay that for a film or even a coffee or a beer- not sure why people think you shouldn't expect to for a good (ad-free & no in-game purchases) game.
ten divittorio : this is an incredible game that has survived the "ages". i first played it on pc, and was thrilled to see an extension on mobile devices. my only only complaint is that there isn't more ! hoping to see another timeless masterpiece like this one in the future. well done, developers.
erik weddell : initially i really liked liked this game. i thought it was a full game and that the second episode was available for purchase!wrong! total scumbag con job. this is a free demo! they want to charge you half way in for a game that is advertised as free. a free game doesn ' t end half way through. a free game should have a start and a finish. this is a demo!!!! shame on you. i don't like the false advertising. just charge me up front, so i know what i get, instead of the bait and switch. i won't pay now!
semir teskeredzic : great atmosphere with adequatly logical puzzles. i can't afford a hefty 5$ second episode but what i have seen so far it probably is quite interesting indeed
miguel carvalho : this is a really nice point and click type of adventure/puzzle, kind of old school pc games by sierra and lucas... first episode was a great change in a long time. brought back good memories. but there is a catch, in my opinion a bit expensive one. if you want to play episode two, almost 5 are required. judging by the time i took to complete the first, it's way too much. i would feel comfortable with 2 (two beers in portugal). more than that for a few hours hours of fun sounds greedy. nice job though. btw it has an annoying bug: if i switch/multi-task from the game to other app and back, it goes quiet. no more sound plays. have to end task and start again. quite annoying...
federico pugnali : nice graphics, nice idea, awful gameplay. unless you like to feel smart plating dumb and obvious games, stay away from this one.
arturchop : this a amazing game it is 100% worth the money to buy chapter 2 also if you are finding it hard use walkthroughs on youtube. well done house on fire
ulon pirmaggins : a masterpiece with no ads. two chapter. one free. 5 bucks for the second if you want to know what happens after. it's as if you paid 2.5 bucks each. common. it worth it price. what other dum stuff with 5 bucks. it worth the experience. play at night with your bluetuth speakers. the mechanic is great. like an upside down heads and tails flipping coin puzzle. everything is pretty logical. even when you don't find it's logical. when finally the solution comes up to you you say to yourself damn why did i not thought to it earlier? the story? classical but... deepness comes in a weird way till an end that you would think... something but... is it really as good bad as it appears. art design tells another story. masterpiece of game. play it one time in your life. you won't regret your five bucks. i only regret not to invest money in the studio of very good developers. they can be proud what they have invented. it's a baby in the craft! thank you guys.
arian ahmadinejad : one of the best puzzle games i've ever played but it's not supported for
android 8 so i cant play it anymore please update it
amy bromley : great but too short. played much better for same or less price. was literally shocked when it ended as i was anticipating several hours more play.
galactic traveller : this game was so taxing on my google phone that it fried the chip. i have to buy a new phone now. i only played it once, and that was all it took.
 : payed for the full game. and its fun. one problem there is an annoying bug that is very relevant for a mobile game. every time i get a call or a message or any notification, the game stops producing sound. hope you fix this aoon.
jay dormiedy : i paid in advance for part 2 years ago and now its telling me i still have to pat for it. not impressed. i loved part 1 so i invested in the company and they screwed me. thank guys.... i guess it took you so long to figure out part 2 that you thought that people would just forget and you just take the money and run!!!
amber h : loved the game, but it's not long enough to pay $5.00 for, i learned that the hard way unfortunately. just stop once you finish the free chapters. hopefully they come out with more chapters for the paid version.
jin lee : good graphics and satisfying sound effects, accompanied by an interesting story and puzzles. the puzzles are quite easy, which is good. however the playtime is very short and i'm not sure if it's worth $4.
sir didymus : great game, good story. only small complaint is its a bit much to pay for a fairly short game.
briggy : played this originally in 2016 and only gave it 4 stars. think i was new to this genre and didn't realize what a gold mine this game is. just played it again and it is easily a 5 star game.
amir monshi : second episode is the final episode. it's not worth the money because the whole game is too easy and it has a lame ending. as if producers didn't have the budget to continue the project. randal's monday is cheaper and way more challenging and fun.
ken chen : my favorite mobile platform game! i've played through it several times and
it's great and refreshing to have something with such a beautiful story and
intuitive controls combined with tricky problem solving when you play
through the first time.
salome fromonteil : the most amazing game i've played so far ! just perfect : great gameplay, just perfectly challenging, a lot of going back and forth (but not for nothing, i've loved it). i've never thought such a great game could be available on phone (could have been much better on computer i think) but it really makes me wonder : should i buy the second part ? i don't know if i should but i really want to. so worth it.
nik t : only just found this game and its blowen me away, its such an original setup and story for a game, its a must to play and you must purchase the second half, i highly recommend this game
karla palasciano : after the 1st chapter you are asked to pay for the 2nd one. i was expecting a lot more for the 5$ , and after the "very easy to beat" 2nd chapter the game ends. very unsatisfying
adam cardenas : the puzzles here are a bit on the rehash the formula over and over side. i'm still interested, no spoilers, but i'm expecting/predicting a very cliche/overdone ending
aubrey wingo : engaging storyline, definitely got me to spend the money to keep going. was
hoping that there was little bit more at the very end.
rafik kazikhanov : great story, no regrets buying it-just wish there was a bigger twist ending. a depressingly bleak view on current human interactions-to be honest i'd call it a bit dramatic.
shankar kakaraparti : hmm.. didn't quite like the ending. too simple. also no explanation about lambert. please make silent age 2 and add some more conspiracy to it. for a great story with such a great potential, it has to have a sequel
shatyia givens : loved it i love this game so much. it's not only challenging but it has great graphics. a huge no-no was having to buy the second part, or episode, but overall i thought it was a good game.
john kieffer : great for a few laughs and some brain exercise. i recommend taking your time and enjoy the comedic interaction between efforts to use objects incorrectly. god bless you folks, believe in jesus.
a google user : meh. there's not much to solve/figure out, but a lot of pointless walking around. game play is pretty slow.
mopar man : this is an amazing game. blew me away for a cellphone game. the visuals, storyline, audio are superb. love that its set in the 70's, and done right too! between the characters hair, the cop car, lava lap. etc. i would love to see more games downnthe pipe... maybe an 80's manhunter style game next?
andrew volk : spent the day with family playing both episodes on chrome cast. such a great mystery/puzzle sci-fi game. very impressive for an app. reminds me a little of flashback on snes. i hope they come out with more episodes or more games like this!
maximiliano podostroiec : too lineal, puzzles are jokingly easy, unoriginal story, bland character.
bertie van : loved playing part 1. have considered paying uk 4 for the rest of the game, but i'm not a massive game player so feel that it wasn't with it for me.
jason k : really nice atmosphere in this short point and click. interesting premise and core mechanic of switching between time periods. $5 seems a but pricy if 2nd episode us the same length, but i'm interested in more of this.
alexander goncharenko : huge unbearable bug. if game gets interacted by some phone sound(message,
notification etc) the game sound disappear till next session.
wouter de bie : really liked this game. the puzzles weren't too difficult, but i really liked the setting and vibe. the time paradox is a nice twist that makes for an interesting storyline. even though the game was fairly short, it was worth the money.
tons0fun071 : just bought the second episode great concept for a game, very well written and the game engine is smoother than butter on a baby's ass. good stuff team
noddio r. : it's not good for huawei phones because cant guit the game as we don't have physical home buttons not back button.
ugnius petrauskas : i'm not exactly one for good reviews but this game hits a certain sweet spot. it has puzzles that are easy enough to solve, it has a great story and it doesn't shove ads in your face. 3 for a good story and a nice expierence, i'd say it's worth it.
shane hollebon : great game, logical combinations of items. price is a bit expensive but still cheap entertainment.
martino imanuel : great point n click game. love the puzzle. and good story. just finished the first one, and its a really good game that makes me curious to beat the puzzle.
michelle abel : finally!, an appropriately challenging game that is also intuitive. the story line and dialogue are intriguing, and at times, humorous! the graphics are simple and yet, complete and atmospheric. i feel satisfied, and yet a little sad now that i completed the game. i am anxiously awaiting the next chapter. i hope it won't be a long wait!
ajay singh : why is this game asking permission to make and manage phone calls. a game shouldn't require access to phone calls. a big privacy issue.
blinky catt : i really like the graphics for this game, so clean but still containing so much detail and atmosphere. the story is very immersive too. i bought the second chapter and have no complaints.
jonathan seyghal : pretty but dumb, really not challenging and quite unrewarding, not to mention the huge amount of cut scenes that last ages and are pretty painful. unsatisfactory ending too, couldn't believe it was the end!
brendan engles : even years after completing the game i still come back to play it from time to time. the soundtrack and design are just wonderful and enthralling and i highly recommend this game to anybody who will listen!
md sehbub ahmed : i rated it one star cause it asked me to pay for $5 after completing 1st episode.i don't here to pay $5 for next.
nick tkach : really great point and click adventure. high production value. obviously a lot of time and thought put into this. great balance between challenge and progress.
maria elizabeth : what a great concept! really like the past and the future concept.. the plot is really intriguing, the puzzles are not too hard to solve.. liked the ending, but it's sad to see that joe is always by himself.. however, overall it's a great game with a great concept..
erwin rossen : a point and click adventure as one should be. good story, challenging but not frustratingly hard puzzles and a good sound track too. pity that the story in the paid version is not longer than it is.
francesco leonini 007 2 : very much enjoyed both the free and paid versions, please add chapters for those who paid~thanks.
steve laber : i wish this game was free completely. you should put ads so we can play and not spend 5 dollars just to complete the god damn story.
sam davies : fantastic game, brilliantly paced only to be let down with the last chapter. felt like it was rushed and far too simple. i'd pay for the next game if i knew another was to be released soon. although that doesn't seem to be the case. all the best!
mohammad tawash : good game and p2 longer than p1. payed for it. i hope the ending will have
some kind of explanation or what is the story message. i like it
brian valencia : i liked the story, it was very challenging and helped pass time. i wanted to play more but part 2 is way too expensive. i would of gave it 5 stars if the second part had a reasonable price.
dentzing huynh : i loved the game! i thought the story was just incredible. wouldn't mind if some puzzles were a bit more challenging.
sean baldwin : fun adventure with a great time travel element. great dialogue that made me laugh more than once.
a google user : i played on a friend's ipad, i loved it and got soooo excited when i saw it, but when i downloaded and opened it, it took a long time to load, and the walls and everything but closed doors and rooms and people are blue. dang it.
joan paycoan : this game is kinda like a mind game. i love it! too bad a thirteen year-old like me couldn't afford part 2. i'd have to wait for a month to forget how to finish the game so i could play it again.
firman rusdi bachtiar : i can't stop playing this game. so excited, still don't understand the ending. many question, about what happened.
felipe alvarez : finished in 2 days. wonderful story. ending was a bit lacklustre.
samuel brown : this game was the best game i've downloaded so far. love the suspenseful music. awesome game! gotta buy part 2 though. bummer!
nina vizcarra : i like the aesthetics of the game. the game itself is alright. not too
difficult; just about fine if you want a game that makes you think a
little. the concept of time travelling in a escape game is quite
interesting too.
tai tran : this is one of the best adventure game i have played so far. amazing story, not so ridiculous puzzles and artful graphics+music. worth every penny.
jerome ocampo : first played this game on steam. old point and click mechanics but brings a lot more to the table in terms of story.
a google user : played for free then had to pay to continue the game. wouldn't normally pay but game was enjoyable, however the cost is not outweighed by the content afterwards. would avoid!
karilee anderson : "sweet mercy...it's like riding sidecar with a unicorn down a mountain of cashmere sweaters"! ... hee hee! i loved this game and story. worth every penny, and you know right away that after the second chapter, if you want to continue playing the game ( 8 more chapters) you can pay a minimal price, and there are no ads. great job developers! give us more?
kate moore : this game is amazing! i love part one an two but i'm a little sad it ended. over all this is an outstanding game with both great gameplay and story line.
mary trouy : only the first part of the game is free, so be prepared to pay a little to finish the game. it was an interesting story, good graphics, and great atmosphere. your character walks a little slow which sometimes felt like lag but the game ran smoothly.
elder waters : love the game cool art style cool story, just wish the other episodes were less expensive, i would by them for .99 but not 5 dollars.
a google user : game mechanics could be improved and the speed of interaction.. based on
the amount of puzzles, i moved around more than i solved puzzles.
a google user : the retro style, the funny comments the main character makes when you try
to perform nonsensical actions, the very interesting story, and the the
clever puzzles all make this game worth playing.
james ford : didn't use a walk through as the difficulty was just right. 4 for episode 2 is far too high a price though. should be 2
ilinca : amazing i played this game 3 years ago, when i was 9. keep up the good
work. i will never get tired of it. great job.
cheyenne forrester : i enjoyed this game a lot. it's just really, really short, and i'm
reluctant to buy the second episode due to that. if it's as short as the
first one was, i'd think $2 would be way more appropriate than $5.
pola : i was only supposed to check it out before going to bed. it was so good it made me stay until 5am (from about 2am). i only wish it were longer as it is just perfect. third part, please?
a google user : the game loses sound if my phone receives a notification while i'm playing.
have to restart the game to get the sound back. it's very annoying.
diana bailey : every think very good but instead the 9th episode, and look close its all pixely and it will like the indie games, you should add another session, plus cute down the price on it to like 3 dollars.
sofia : would have preferred to know before hand that i had to pay to play. will put to the side and think about if its worth it or not
google user : very good overall game. controls are simple, story is good, decent character development and pretty good replayability. puzzles aren't difficult, but sometimes require a lot of running back and forth.
chris poulos : amazing. easy, yet difficult. no changes needed. willing to pay 5 dollars for next chapter
jim passantino : for $5 you get a fun game with a story you really get into and it take about 4 hours to complete. please do others like this!
umang : you need to pay a hefty amount in order to unlock the next episode.
jamie tew : a very good game, one of my favourite although you had to pay for part 2 but definitely worth it
chris johnson : good story, clues not too esoteric like some other games. atmospheric as well. worth the 4 for part 2
adam sadigh : i loved it. i even paid the 5 extra bucks for it. but it left me sad to find out the story ended that way. we need more.
momoftwo : i would've bought it if they said it upfront before i installed it
shannon allen : very fun and practical point and click adventure game. all puzzles are common sense. acting is great and story line was great. cons: $5 for 2nd episode but worth it and basic graphics.
jimmy hafseth : very good overall. a bit pricey considering its shortness, but good
robin manford : originally i gave the game 5 stars but upon revisiting and seeing the game make very suspicious requests like access to my phonebook, i am now lowering my review to 3 stars.
setiawan surya : i hope there will be games like this in the future. after completing this game i look around and find none that matches this level of awesomeness
travis moore : even though the second half of the game had to be paid for it was worth it. can't wait for more games like this. i was addicted to it from the start
amanda cummings : amazing little game. wish it was longer. not sure why it has so many bad
reviews. it's 4, that's the cost of a rubbish cafeteria sandwich. people
saying they got stuck, well yeah, the whole point is that it makes you
problem solve. i absolutely loved it. the graphics really fit with the
story, the story itself was quite chilling and the soundtrack was great!
definitely use headphones when playing! hope you guys make another game
like it!
jason telford : it's as much a story as a puzzler. and just a nice place to explore and discover the environment. sometimes, there is a "click everything" but overall controls are good.
rip-streams by donalex : all i can say is that i enjoyed this beautiful game, wish it had me then 2 episodes. the story was epic and kept you curious til the end and very easy to interact with all. good job.
pisodisc : barely any gameplay until you have to pay. would be fun if it didn't end so quickly. don't bother
jasper walker : i like it, a lot. not too easy not too hard. the level of suspense is awesome. controls are pretty solid. great job guys. please donate so that i could enjoy the 2nd episode, hopefully it's longer.
natalie lintner : i'm kind of disappointed that i paid for part two and there isn't any sound.
heckingdog : there's an issue with sound. upon receiving notifications from any other app, all ingame sounds stops. i've tried a lot of things but the only thing that fixes it is closing the game and reopening it
christina checchi : well i really enjoyed this game. love the feel of it, but i'm not sasitfied with the ending. hopefully they will make more games like this and maybe a sequel. :)
jose bezerra : nice game, one of best i've ever played on mobile phones, it's a pity that it's too short, i hope that another part to be released someday.
itsuki matsuo : the story is great and gameplay is smooth, but it would be better if we could run, walking during scenes make the game slow and take away the joy. thank you.
tushar khandelwal : found this game by chance and it has me hooked. everything is so well thought out from the game play to the graphics to the controls and the storyline just flows well. i love that you can play chapter 1 for free which is enough of a hook before purchasing chapter 2. can't wait to see where this goes.
kim leih : why pay for episode two the first one is very short anyways, not worth buying. :(
maggie b : a brilliant puzzle game that makes you think but isn't impossible! loved the story and the characters. animation was fantastic
anthony francis : love this game. the story should be made into a feature length film. the score is very atmospheric and the visuals remind me of flashback. we'll worth 4 quid for the second episode. great job by the developer.
laziekat : the game is so amazing and catchy, and its price is almost nothing, i really think that a longer story and a good director could make it a really good movie!
joao campos : amazing game. really nice storyline and graphics. pity that the full version is quite expensive. still think it's worth a shot, the game is really entertaining and addictive.
chewbroccoli : the story line is the best part. the main character is made to seem a little too ditsy in my opinion. the first part is free then they charge you to open up the second chapter which is almost double the length of the first. the price for this is steep considering the graphics are hardly ground breaking.
yash pawar : what a game ! i dont have words for saying. all things are perfect graphics,gameplay,controls. the developers didn't made any mistake. awesome, superb game i ever played
aizen julian : loved it! i was so involved i enjoyed every moment of suspense. wish their were more episodes though. 5 stars!
laurie smith : this game is built on a very interesting concept but it was a bit boring and easy. a pit pricy too.
a google user : loved the story, simple gameplay and art. all around good experience. time
travel is a genre i wish had more attention in gaming. although, i wish the
game were longer for $5.
abdul rehman : im very selective when it comes to mobile phone games and i have never written a review for any game, but this game is a masterpiece, definetly a must play. intriguing story, the game play is streamlined and really makes you think. deserves a 5 star rating!
keyan beard : this is easily one of the best point and click mystery game i've played. excellently crafted atmosphere with the sound and visuals. loved playing it. worth every penny for episode 2. keep up the good work.
josjuar lister : i first found this game before the completion of episode 2 and i fell head over heals in love!!!! i'm a great fan and i've replayed the whole game many times since i completed both the episodes, just for the atmosphere and the thrill of watching joe solve the mystery!! i applaud you! house on fire games! and i really look forward to the sequel... the silent age 2.... (hint, hint)
can uzer : everything is great, especially art, sound and music. not a big fan of voice-overs. my passion died however after opening the game and seeing that all my progress was vanished.
katrine eunice dc quianzon : just download it, guarantee that you'll enjoy a retro themed puzzle game. very engaging actually, the plot is quite familiar but outstanding. though it's a little too short for my liking even with the episode 2 nevertheless i think it i get why it ended that way. worth the money folks :d
fas fas : clean visuals, smooth interactiveness, intuitive play, engaging story - i'd love to see more episodes between 1 and 2 that expand on the story...
himanshi : hey what am i am stucked....i think the game is more further ....what am i supposed to do after finding the blood stain and showing it to the secretery
anthony micele : fantastic journey following joe, and ordinary man thrust into an ever expanding adventure. one of the best surprises i've stumbled upon in a long time.
hamna tahir : i had been looking for an adventurous game and this fit the description
right in. still on the first episode but till now the graphics , story and
art direction is really great. good job team!
crow : after getting to the fourth chapter, i can no longer play. when attempting to start the app i only get the h.o.f logo and then a black screen. app won't work!
a google user : simply awesome! the only complain is that this game is too short for the price u have paid..
maya weisinger : honestly this is one of the best games i've ever played. the graphics are beautiful, the storyline is smart and captivating, and each level presents significant, interesting challenges. i was super sad when i finished episode 2. waiting for the next!
dav clark : nice that you get a full game to explore before buying the exciting bit. a total kings/space quest throwback, but more tappy and with a nice time travel game mechanic. definitely worth a play.
nabannugak : really well-made story, great design, great gameplay. the puzzles weren't too hard but hard enough that it kept you thinking, and the story was mysterious enough to keep you playing. definitely one of the games i don't regret spending real money on. hope they make something like this again!
m. m. leal : i'm just in love with this game, so addictive and great history. haven't played such a good game since the cube series. deserves 5 starts. i'm seriously thinking about buying the paid chapter.
poochilli pickles : really interesting, but if you are going to charge us for the second episode, just have the actual game cost money, not just the episode.
chris balcom : it's a good game but i finished episode two real quick
frank swannack : gripping well-paced adventure with interesting puzzles. joe is an endearing
character with a great sense of humour. the quality graphics and sound
perfectly create the mysterious ambience. well worth paying for ep.2 as i
couldn't stop playing the game until i had finished it. highly recommended.
willy diaz : this is a great game, and it would be even better if the 2nd episode were free. if you can't make it free, then at least reduce the price to like 99 cents or something
jemima kwok : oh man i love this game. the visuals, the gameplay, the story. this is pretty much the only kind of game that can hold my attention.
redfyre fox : great point-and-click puzzle. it's not too difficult, otherwise it could make you lose interest. i love the time travel slash dead world concept. good graphics and story. i enjoyed it.
ava hursey : i thought this was a simplistic game once it caught my eye, but the gameplay was intresting, and the art style was extraordinary. i love to play this game, and the intresting turns inside of it are pleasantly surprising.
richard carless : beautifully stylised graphics and simple but effective point and click controls. great story driven game, let down only by gameplay that is far too linear for this genre. enjoyable, but not too taxing.
swol natsuki : try it out, first half is free and if you're into point and click sifi adventure games then consider buying the last half.
dmitry pashkevich : great story, very good looking and immersive visuals. feels like you travel through time together with the main character. the puzzles are a bit too easy, but the game is still very enjoyable.
pedja markovic : hm. great story, but it was told through narration, not gameplay. at the
end, one pays 5 euros to be explained what's goong on, not to play it.
a google user : this game is a true masterpiece. the story is very interesting and keeps me wanting to play it. great job on this game.
declan mcnulty : i loved it. wish it was longer, but still i felt it was good value for money. a cut above any other game i have played on a smart phone
steven welch : wow..i am really enjoying this! thank you!! edit: already finished it but for me, worth the price. very nicely done. a few puzzles had me confused but after thinking about solutions, they were logical. well done.
jannese _ : a really good storyline with amazing gameplay and graphics. my only problem is that there are only 5 short chapters in episode one and you need to pay $5 to get episode two.
nurul ramadani nasution : nice story line. completely immersed with this game and its story. really curious about the next chapter thou but it's so expensive :( but nice work! totally in love with this game.
joao campos : one of the best games that i ever played. to bad that episode 2 isn't free.
sarah havard : i really enjoyed the free demo, without knowing how many more levels there are i'm reluctant to pay 4
saturday sazaran : took me forever to figure out how to change the game language which started in spanish for some reason. not finished the game yet, but so far the puzzles have more to do with walking between locations in the right order rather than actual puzzling.
ayden salazar : i love this game but i've been waiting for season 2 to come out for about a year and it's out but you have too pay for it at least make episode 1 of season 2 free or lower the price to 3 dollars or something like that
rhiannon gleed : i liked it but the sound cut out mid way through episode 1 and i never heard a peep since idk why :/
adrian arif : great. time travelling is always fun. but the second episode it way too expensive.
