braedyn blachowski : such a time consuming game i started playing it an hour ago, and couldn't stop. the best part of this game is that theres not that many ads. but sometimes the game bugs out, and i can't jump. also its one of those games that are really relaxing and is about beating your high score on that you got on your last round. overall, adictive and fun game.
deepak dawny : really good casual game. there are very few ads, and the interface is smooth. but i didn't really like the fact that sometimes the screen seems too zoomed it, so that its difficult to know what is coming up
baking artist : awesome game. very relaxing, gorgeous and breathtaking scenery, and wonderful music. zen mode is great for practice and relaxing. only issue is i have no idea where my photos are saving to.
moein diarjani : the only mobile game that is on my essential phone apps list always. serves me more like a meditation tool rather just a game. entertaning and relaxing. and the best music and sound. we need more games like this.
ilaitia powell : i love this game its so peaceful and the music is relaxing. there will be ads but that only happens if you forgot to turn your data off or leave your wifi connected. i love the music in the endless version where you just keep going without no goats or points. just you and the music. whats the name of that music tho?
david strong : i love this game! it's so cool that you can just go down and up hills, also you don't have to watch so many ads right after you fall off the snow board. all the abilitys you can use makes it so fun! that's why i am giving this game a 5 star review!
fletcher moffett : this game is satisfying and relaxing but also energetic enough to be entertaining. highly recommend. it has mico transactions but most are just short cuts to what you'll get later for free.
charlotte jones : amazing! it is definitely fantastic for a mobile game. the attention to detail with the sounds and gameplay are phenomenal! great job noodlecake & snowman!
freeks : do you know this is the best game i've ever seen.this is not just a game this is something special it's graphics it's sound effects it's background music all are just amazing thanks to the devoloper for this masterpiece.
cezar haim : this game is absolutely amazing the graphics are good. its basically beating your high score but as you continue there are some bugs.
d14_oficial : the nostalgia is real, and it hasn't changed one bit as far as i remember, and that makes me really happy taking in account what some games have turned into
momo letlhake : this is one of the most relaxing games i've ever played. it relieves stress easily too. highly recommend for those who want a simple yet adventurous game.
prathamesh khopade : i just saw this game on the categories so decided to give it a try, but holy!!! this is much more than i expected!! and that too so minimalistic and low size game! amazing and thanks for the game
christian nash : i have played this for a while now and i love this game. the zen mode is just relaxing and the music is just calm and relaxing. best game like this i have ever played
omm narayan dehury : mind coll game. and it's graphics are so beautiful try it. i never play like this game it's so beautiful mind blowing.
henry gregg : when you get into playing this you will realise how good it really is. there are plenty of goals to achieve dont spend your accumulated coins to pass goals you are struggling with as on level 30 something you need to spend 7000 on a suit. gameplay is excellent. several years later i've completed all the tasks. it is still an enjoyable frustrating game.
danney az : simple and beautiful arcade game! please developers, lighten up night time, i cannot see a thing while playing in broad daylight hahaha (not joking, pls do it)
ben the burger : i like the peacefulness of the music in it it would be really cool if they made it to where you could put your own music to the trac
thomas palmer : a super fun game. at first it might seem some what simple, but it is consistently fun, and consistently difficult. i really enjoy the challenges and unlocking the new characters. the wingsuit is a perfect way to add something new when you get proficient with the snowboard. love this game and i'll play alto's odyssey as soon as i'm done this one!
itz_saty : if you are a type of guy who don't like games like cod or pubg, this is the way to go. this game is chill, relaxing, close to zero ads even if you are connected to network. you may think this is just a repetetive game just like subway surfers but it's not. the characters, the missions, the wingsuit combos, the backflips is what makes to get connected to the game. at last i just want to say, just try it out once if you never have played this before. thank you devs.
nishant mishra : i've never seen a game this simple that keeps me hooked to it. super beautiful graphics, changing weather, multiple transitioning biomes, procedurally generated landscape and a day/night cycle, and as if that wasn't enough features already, it has a "zen mode" to play without interruptions or obstacles. 10/10 would recommend.
sangeet borpuzari : in one word- perfect. this game has what it takes to be a proper game. from the outside it may feel like a normal game but the music and playstyle is what that flips the coin. the challenges, characters with different speed and flipping time enables you to play this game at your own style. i always do a flip in the very beginning using maya and that's what i love, its my style but other's game. :)
josh : a truly wonderful game to play in your free time or whenever. the game have relaxing music and nice ambient sounds. simple, yet great design and subtle details. what i want to see included is more music to choose from, especially when you are playing in zen mode. overall, the game is amazing.
saksham bhadauria : best minimalist game ever with most soothing, calming background music.
catalin verman : great game! free, easy to control, a lot of fun to play, great gtaphocs, changing environments during the mission. (e. g. start at daylight, finish at dawn). it is got a zen mode if you wish to play without being disturbed to start again from the beginning with the tasks given for that specific mission. i also recommend to install alto's odyssey
a google user : a sensationall masterpiece! very calming and relaxing and the soundtrack is wonderfull no adverts and no distractions 10/10
ralph laptop : stunning game, apparently simple but with surprising depth. almost perfect. my only significant issue is that the screen isn't well configured for left-handed players; you can move the pause button to the right of the screen, but the wingsuit button is always in the middle on the left, which makes it very hard to avoid clicking by accident if you play with your left thumb. some of my biggest frustrations playing the game have come right at the end of a flawless long combo that should have earned me tens of thousands of points, only for me to accidentally activate or deactivate the wingsuit at the last moment with the edge of my thumb and crash. so frustrating!
shannon berridge : so relaxing. i love the ambient sounds. headphones a must. great game to play winding down in bed before sleep. one tap controls are very easy, yet don't diminish the gameplay. highly recommend. lots to unlock to keep you coming back. another tip. if you want the ambient feeling enhanced. turn off music and just have sound effects. ambient sounds are awesome in this. really take you away.
matt anderson : i enjoy the hell out of this game, it is easy to learn, but hard to master. and, as i find most important for phone games, it has a surprising variety in gameplay - with different goals, which unlock characters with new abilities. and, something i never knew i wanted, a game with calming music and beautiful visuals and scenery. unfortunately there's no way to "win" that i know of (it's an endless level until you die), but that's my only complaint & i enjoyed everything else. worth your download.
nikola rakic : great game! actually both of the games in the series are great. it is so relaxing and it forces you to be creative by combining different types of stunts. i really enjoy it. there are a few bugs, for example when i crash in the chasm i can't relive the character, because it's just stuck in the chasm. other than that it is great - graphics, music, gameplay... just great :)
thalia : this is a very well coded and structured game. the gameplay is smooth and absolotely fantasic, unlike anything i've ever seen. the art style of adorable and very simple. the music is so relaxing and again.. absolotely wonderful. the only problem though is that sometimes, when the time of day is night, i am unable to see the rocks. i don't know what you can do for that... but again.. good job creators and staff!!!
orridicus40 : this game is a lot of fun! it's simple, challenging and relaxing at the same time. the graphics and are great. i like the upgrades you can purchase (with in game currency). i purchased the remove ads feature to support devs and this game is worth it imo. one thing i do wish that would be added is an upgrade ability to be able to back flip faster! thanks for the great game!!!
cicada carpenter : i played this before playing the sequel alto's odyssey, and while i prefer the second game, this one still holds up! my only complaints are that the llama mechanic feels sort of pointless outside of missions (scores alone have never been a motivator for me), and there's a particular chasm (two small gaps in quick succession) that's nearly impossible to clear if you're going too fast. worth a try if you loved the sequel, but want something a little different!
jemima h : amazing. it's very difficult to come up with something that's actually negative about this game! past personal preferences and the rare bug, the game itself has little to no issues. the option of playing on 'zen mode' were you can just go down an endless hill with endless lives and incredible music is a great addition to the main game that i regularly use! overall, its the best mobile app i've found in a long time, and i strongly suggest installing it even if it's just to try it out!
nasif quadir : really just an amazing game all around. the art and backgrounds are simple and well made. your movement through the snow banks is incredibly smooth, and as long as you're paying attention, nothing really feels unfair with one exception. when the screen switches to night mode, it starts to become difficult to see your player character. another issue is that i can't use my wing suit. i unlocked it several weeks ago, but after i closed the app and reopened it, the icon disappeared.
cimsoc cosmic : 11/10. beautiful and simple graphics, easy-to-learn but hard-to-master gameplay, and amazing music to top it all off. there are multiple different players to unlock that change the game a little in their own way, and the wingsuit adds a whole new, fun element once you've gotten used to everything else. overall summary? a simulation of running away from old people with your feet tied to a slab of wood, racing llamas, jumping over chasms upside down, and de-shingling innocent townspeoples' homes.
christian maher : i love this game. it's brilliant. 1 small little problem though. everytime i end the game, the next time i have to keep starting from the very 1st level. tutorial and all. also, it's never been able to sign into google play once. it just stays on the same "connect to google play now. - later - yes". i would love help with this from anyone please.
arriane jane : nice graphics, its not hard to the eyes. the sound effects is also very relaxing and it matches the pace of the game. what i like the most is you have an option for "zen mode" which you can just play without you dying. downside is sometimes its lagging (a bit) if you get the power ups ( magnets etc.) but its okay for me. i purchased all the characters since im soo excited to try them all. lol. if you dont want to purchase them, you need to pass certain level to get them. really amazing game.
hanikhqn : it's nice! i totally understand the ads in between after dying, because you want to get benefit too. however, you need to buy characters. i'm not sure if you can use coins, but so far it only showed currency numbers. i wish you could use coins like at least 4 characters using coins? it'd be interesting to be able to change characters. the game is also very calming, i really liked the mode! ( i dont remember the name ) but the sound effects and everything, it feels refreshing. really recommend!
falanga alona : this game is one of the best i've played. especially zen mode. i've been struggling with depression and just the sound of nature and soft music in the background really helped. i just wish the endless mode had an option you could change the song in the background, that just give it a little boost and i would give this a six out five. but still love it!!
levi christopherson : a very calming time killer. if you want just a calm game to play when you're bored or when you're out and have no wifi, this is the game for you. the soundtrack and visuals are outstanding, and the gameplay is engaging and very satisfying. one of my favorite mobile games. if you like this, also check out the sequel, "alto's odyssey." very similar with the main differences being in terrain and soundtrack.
mitchell quong : keep in mind i got this game when it was free but i have seen it as expensive as $19 on some platforms and i don't think it's worth that much. for $2 or less this is pretty great. its a super simple game with simple controls so easy to hop in and out of. the art design is what is really great about this game, super beautiful. one of my favorite offline games to pass 10 or 20 mins without having to feel committed to it.
a google user : this is one of the best games i've ever played, i consider this as a work of art. the visuals, the music ,the gameplay etc. this is my most favourite offline game, i highly recommend this to everyone! i would've liked even more stunning environments and characters though . developers, this can become revolutionary if you keep on adding more things to the game ! also....what are you waiting for ......download it already!!!!!!!!!!!
indra farizal : i found a bug where when it crashes and starts again, sometimes it can't jump. i even clicked on the screen rapidly, and what happened.. still couldn't jump, and ended up crashing into a rock. hope this review was useful, and bugs fixed as soon as possible. thanks for this addictive game
summer paris : beautiful graphics, nice game play, simple in the best way. it would be better if the reset option didn't take away your gold. it would also be fun to try the levels with different characters once you've finished the game instead of having to start the game all over again and unlock all the characters gradually.
doody tco : hey i have a problem with one of the tasks level 55, "pick up a coin magnet 4 times in one run..." the magnets i pick never counts, i've took up to 6 and the bug persists, please help. .... i have never uninstalled this game from any device i own once it is downloaded, love the simplicity of the graphics, the breath taking melody, the nice sound effects and how simple and original the gameplay is. whenever i want to rest and want to play, alto's is my choice since it was released.
a google user : i love both this game as well as alto's odyssey. the entire feel of these games are very relaxing and the simplicity of the gameplay plays very well the soothing music, not to mention the minimalist but beautiful graphics. my only complaint about this game would be the ads, they really remove you from the experience. i know you can pay to get rid of them but i'm super cheap so i guess that's partly my fault.
polar bear : really good. i like the gameplay, the graphics etc, but the thing i really like is the coins. coins in alto's adventure basically mean skipping things and going on to the next level. the good thing about these coins are that you collect them on runs. you can buy coins, or just go on several runs to get the same amount. other games force you to pay. and that is why i recomend alto's adventure.
omkar sawardekar : great animations and soothing music while playing! it is a endless snowboarding game with soothing music and beautiful landscapes with perfect sound effects. we can choose various characters with special ability for each. they can be unlocked by completing the levels. relaxing music in adventure as well as in zen mode. easy controls and simple gameplay. great work team alto!
vincent chase : i've had this game for a while now and it is still my favourite. its very calm and the music makes me want to go on an adventure. it's a greatway to unwind. it's also accessible to people like me with mobility issues because its only one button to play the whole game no difficult controls. also i just found out that if you swipe left on the homescreen you can access zen mode where you don't have to restart if you crash.
logan hughes : great game. really relaxing. i like each of the characters a lot, and unlocking them through the achievements is a great experience. edit: i have found a few bugs. sometimes if i'm going really fast, i don't pick up the magnet or feather items. or even coins sometimes.
shadow killer : one of the most wholesome games out there. just a good little game to pass the time with, and if you want, you can even purchase a handcrafted llama with personal little name tag from germany. simple graphics, lovely soundtrack, and a great atmosphere. combine that with simplistic but easy to learn controls and you have a very fun little game. keep it going snowman/noodlecake
snake cute : this game is truly amazing. the graphics are amazing and there have been plenty of moments when i've had to pause to do something and i pause on an amazing skyscape that i can't help but screenshot. personally, i like to play on zen mode but everything is super nice. it's easy to relax and has beautiful music. i have found hardly even a bug, and this game is just so good. i highly recommend giving it a try.
n-word jim : i absolutely adore this game. is is just so relaxing and when you land a double backflip onto a stone bounce off and do another backflip it feels amazing. this and it's brother, alto's odyssey, are some of the very few games i have purchased to get ad free. not because the ads are too annoying but because i feel the game is worth my support. thank you.
rayz playz : this game is absolutely beautiful and the overall art style and gameplay is just phenomenal, and the addition of different wheather patterns is really nice. i highly reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys calm and addictive games, because that is exactly what this is. fun, simple and addicting. one slight concern that i have about this game is that it can be quite difficult to see the different obstacles when it turns to night, but that's nothing too major. it's still a great game :)
bryan altea : so beautiful. simple, yet elegant. anyone could play this. i appreciate the zen mode as it is really relaxing. oh and the music.. the sounds.. the view.. just captivating. it has its challenges, and also the rush you get from riding across the snow with the changing weather and background is just.. ugh. so good. highly recommended. not time consuming, purely casual, and relaxing. great job!
niaaa__ : this game is seriously fun! it is so exciting to play. it is also very aesthetic and calm. the way the background changes following the time (morning, evening, night) are just so cool. the music and everything. i love it! but just one thing is that, it is kinda hard actually to jump when you have a rock on a clift. but other than that, everything are awesome! 5 stars total!
adwitiya sarkar : this and alto's odyssey are by far the best games i've ever played. beautiful graphics, awesome music, simple gameplay. if you're feeling down and want to relax, this game is the way to go. i keep coming back every so often to reinstall, and i finish all the levels. definitely my comfort game. 10000/10 would recommend.
jacob hartong : amazing game! everything about it is great. the music, graphics, controls, and overall gameplay was some of the best i've seen. and it has zen mode which is great to relax to and teaches you about how the game is played. if you do not already have either of the alto games (adventure and odyssey) you need to get these games.
nahome tesfay : great game. the graphics are amazing. particularly sunrise and sunset. the game play is more engaging than you'd expect considering how sparse the controls are. the characters are also well made (well i can't speak to the elder because i haven't unlocked them yet). each one has strengths and weaknesses and none of them are useless, overpowered, or gimmicky (well except felipe, he seems gimmicky to me). overall alto's adventure is relaxing, beautiful, and fun.
jonathan mak : this is the sort of chill mobile game that i've been looking for. non of this constant progressing/daily grind that other game sells. a real pick up & put down game that you play at your own pace. minimal ads - but i loved it so much that i gave my support. feedback to dev: - sometimes does bug out where i can't jump from the start, to which i just restart and it works fine after - would be nice to add in meter to ground where you cannot see ground (like the elder chase meter)
bofflesocks : amazing. it's fun, relaxing, and simple with skill involved. the music is really calming and i love the feeling of discovery. if you just want to chill you can go into zen mode and if you want more of a challenge the game provides you with tasks to complete. it isn't really time consuming like over games and has very little ads.
prince nwegbu : awesome. graphics are spot on. this game really tries to make the adventure a good experience. its not your typical sunway surfers, where nothing really goes on except the same obstacles over and over again and the characters are hilariously overpriced. theres so many gimics that keep the adventure enticing, like change of weather skating on flags and vines. the sequel is on point as well. can't wait for the next sequel!!!
michelle martos : it's been my favorite game for 3 years. i installed it when i was 12 and couldn't stop playing until i unlocked every character, feeling excitement whenever i did. the only real complaint i have is sometimes when i press down, the character doesn't respond. i've downloaded and un-installed it just to have the joy of unlocking the characters all over again. great game!
koleman knapp : 'added after original reveiw' a feature that would be amazing would be a stats board:)
nischay karthick : i normally don't leave reviews for any games but this game... it's just marvellous. the graphics, the music, the overall asthetic of the game is just amazing. it's so relaxing and graphics are very good, as a digital artist myself i can imagine the time and effort taken to make these graphics. amazing, keep going
ian corrigan : super fun play, simple and addicting, reminiscent of free ski, and line rider. as a free user i don't find the advertisements too obnoxious, and the revive option of watching a longer ad seems fair and has worked nearly all of the time. only one critique that i feel should be mentioned; in the very specific situation that you are being chased by an elder, and are coming upon a hover feather in front of a rock the feather doesn't activate and you crash. it's happened many times
bishal nandi : very very exciting n interesting game. the controls is difficult to master at first but with practice it grows more and more exciting. the way alto travels with immersive skills and collect couns is really fabulous. weather is dynamic and music is cool. one thing that the scenes could be more 3d type rather than 2d. but the overall gameplay is cool. hoping for later updates in future.
darrell till : excellent game. i wrongly dismissed this some years ago as a boring clone of ski safari, but revisiting them both years later, i find that the other has turned into an awful ad-ridden, money-grabbing freemium game, while i find alto to be a much classier and more enjoyable game with greater longevity. you're actually in control in this game. looking forward to playing the sequel when i've taken this as far as i can.
chrismegusta : this might be the best game in the store. easy to play, literally a finger, no need to buy anything really, you can just grind coins through the levels, coins that you either way collect. excellent progression in characters, abilities, power ups and tricks. i'm only sad they have just 2 games. alto's adventure and odyssey are truly excellent.
jony storm : love this game with my heart, it's so simple,yet unique. and the graphics are awesome
squishy : this game is one of those games that you can really just enjoy every time you play it. the visuals, music and gameplay are really atmospheric and beautiful. the ads are optional for reviving, in app purchases don't limit too much and on all that, it's an offline game so you can enjoy it anywhere. 5 stars, this is what a good mobile game should be like
leigh harris : very fluid game to play and light on the ads. visually very very good and very playable. the only addition i would like to see is maybe a credits roll, on completion of the game, with all the characters in the background going down the slopes. the same for altos odyssey.
benjamin chen : overall the gameplay is great and the minimalistic art style is awesome. personally i haven't had any problems with ads and the game runs super smooth. only problem is that after doing every goal, i can say that beating the game is a bit tedious. however, it's still very fun
citty kat : this game is beautiful. i love it i love it i love it. the graphics? stunning. designs? amazing. sounds are also v nice. i haven't played in a while (esp since uni started), but i just gave another game a horrible review bc im mad at the game, and i needed a cheer-up, so i went to the installed games i had and decided to review another. from what i can remember, both adventure and odyssey are spectacular games. nothing wrong with the controls and not too many ads. wonderful.
kalesh true with egret rtjekje : very fun and the visuals are very nice it's not over complicated.
amelia lol : this is a great game. it's so simplistic and calming, the tutorial actually helps, and i love the music choice and the fact the screen isn't to bright. the skins are all unique and fun to play with, and this gives you a challenge but also being a casual stress reliever. 10/10 would recommend.
emma lowry : both games this one and more recent one are both great however after playing both i prefer this one as i like the music more and also how much animation goes into the llamas with the colours and the details like sliding down the hill its very cool also both games have a theme they keep to and characters that can be unlocked are the same so gameplay is quite similar and simple between games overall very good (also not many ads for a mobile games) if you want to compare install alto's odysey!
timothy oliver : overall a very fun and relaxing game that isn't overrun with ads like what many of the other "free to play games" are like. the micro-transcations are pretty reasonable in this game, and are definitely optional as you can easily earn everything by playing the game. unless you really hate ads, which in my opinion, is worth paying 2 dollars for. *plus you get 5,000 coins* keep up the good work guys!
crazy keith : the game is so amazing and everything about it gives me the same cool vibe plus i got from playing geometry dash plus more. the only problem i have is that every time i crash my board and try to go again it forces me into my internet tab for something, i can pay to remove the popups like this but i feel it's not worth it. i think if the developers wanna make money they would need to find a better way because me included, it's hard to not crash in this game.
morse code : game is very well designed. really love the zen mode.
ta meta ta fisika : good graphic, good game, good effect sounds. thanks.
family tab : what a beautiful game wonderful locations surfing in nature marvellous experience thank-you i keep on playing
gaetano settineri : great game, the graphics area elegant, the game play is fun and challenging and the music adds the finishing touches to suck you in completely. the zen mode is a great touch as well for when you want to enjoy the game without bothering with achievements or crashing out.
evelyn stout : i love this game! the visuals are amazing, i got the app solely for the art at first, but the game is fun too, and is really easy to get lost in. all the little details from the sparks on the wire and the birds flying away when you come near makes it truly a work of art. the music isn't bad either.
lysified - luca gerda laszlo : this game is all kinds of chill combined together in a small, simple bundle of enjoyment. it's smooth, beautiful, immersive - so much so that i find myself sometimes just playing it for hours upon hours. would recommend to anyone who likes working towards various goals, seeing improvement in their skills in the game and those who find joy to in simple, engaging gameplay.
sweetiguess : a relaxing and challenging game... i can play for hours and hours without becoming bored.. my top feature is the offline play... being able to play without a connection has saved me more than once... also the aesthetic is absolutely stunning... a++++ to the whole design team... great game. 100% recommend to all mobile gamers (of all age and skill level)
pizza heaven : super fun and esey so time consuming and the perfect game for eney age.
jack whitley : single click game. very nice visuals. i like it.
lwandle siyabonga : wow this game is amazing the graphics are are the best.the music is relaxing.this game is a must have
lev tokol : really good game, great experience. my phone seems to have run into a bug of some sort though, and i was wondering whether it was just for me. tupa tripped, but then fell into a pit. the game refused to continue on to the run end screen. my guess is that the game couldn't figure out whether i was supposed to survive or not. hope this can be solved!
ashley earle : i absolutely love this game!! i always play it when i need to chill or just have some downtime. i personally play zen mode because i just need to go and well zen lol and the fact that this game offers a mode that i can do that in a so nice. i also love the music. it is so relaxing and i often fall asleep to just the music. i don't even have to mention the beautiful art that this game has. i have taken so many screenshots when i pause!!! overall, a very wonderful and relaxing game.
elbio : edit: doh! didn't realize i could buy an ad free version, and for only $2. well worth it for this awesome game! happily purchased and i'm in zen mode again. such a good chill game.. until an ad comes up and ruins it. wish games at least gave an option to buy an ad free version.
gareth schultz : simple, pretty, fun. this is what/how smart phone games should be. beautiful art style and great background music. it is very relaxing, reminds me of a casual free-run in ssx3 i've been looking for a smart phone game like this for awhile. nice to finally find one. many thanks to the team that created this!!! --g
priyabrata deb : from me!!! i can't describe this game.. it is really awesome, i work as stress buster. according to me the best way to enjoy this game is use your earphones. go to game's settings turn of the music. believe you will feel each and every sound effects like the sound of wind, sound of , sound of bells, sound of rain. it is just awesome...
chester : very relaxing without being boring. the background song is one of my favorite mobile game songs period, it sounds adventurous but chill, and the sound effects are satisfying. does a great job at inverting the concept of ski safari making it a very beautiful slower descent down the hills to catch your escaped lamas as opposed to a chaotic scramble to escape an avalanche. if you liked ski safari, you'll like this game for the exact opposite reasons
abhay : nice one game i like that music and those weathers that's feeling so good!
david lee : it's a nice game with the minimum control requirement. i like the music and the graphics. also the option to make an ads free by purchasing is the main reason i'm posting this game. in alto's odyssey thier is no purchasing option to completely kill the ads, which is a no no for me.
maezheillyn bernal : relaxing!i was a bit hesitant at first to even download it, thought it was difficult to control, it turned out to be that easy. plus, the characters were fun. the crossing out of the finished tasks were satisfying. an absolutely beyond breathtaking experience
streamer b.t.w : i've played this game for 3 years straight. graphics are literally butter; or just very smoothe. i prefer this one then the original, and i really don't know why. ads aren't too bad, i guess. i play this game on the way to school, back from school, free time, slacking off homework, late up at night; maybe even midnight. i even slack of chores just to play it . anyways, what i like most about this game are the sounds, glider, compass, characters, and the somewhat annihlation of my phones
emma perry : it's so beuatiful, the gameplay, graphics. i was expecting more at first but then i got more in the other mode. it was so beautiful. the simple gameplay, the artstyle and the music. i also loved the weather patterns and the day cycle. truly a game worth playing, it's like the boy glides as he flies upon the snow, i love it.
j. kaire : this game is absolutely beautiful in terms of both art style, music, performance and smoothness in playing. i also love the fact that the only place the developers put the ads in was the challenge part, not when your enjoying the game in zen mode, and if you died at the start they didn't give you an ad.
priya kaur : it's a wonderful game.. the game is relaxing and it's easy to level up. the graphics are mind blowing, and the music makes it even more relaxing. if your looking for an offline game that's high graphics and fun, altos adventure is definitely your perfect choice.
jaden may : relaxing, generally all around fun. there are some parts such as; "speed, timing, spacing, and spatial differentiality between" that make it that much more difficult (which is a good thing) although it's fun, and amazingly time consuming. you had an hour for lunch, next thing you know you have 5 mins.
virajith perera : absolutely chill and brilliant. this is the only game i played this far. 1. visuals are brilliant. sun rise, sun set, moon shining overhead are just so relaxing. i actually downloaded it for the screenshots and was not disappointed. 2. sense of time, day-night cycle is brilliant. i felt like i have been traveling for says without tiring. 3. music and sfx! sound engineer, take a bow. music was subtle. environment effects were just so real. i felt like it actually rained around me. zen mode!
zaar valathin : beautiful art style, fantastic soundtracks, and soothing gameplay. couldn't ask for more! experienced a few game breaking bugs, which are minor inconveniences due to the play style. and felipe's front legs bend the wrong way. but 5/5, i spend so many hours playing this game.
glen jay madenancil : it's a very fun game. it's minimalist background and the whole concept is simply relaxing. this game literally is something i could say that is healthy to play with but of course with not too much exposure to mobile phones. it's background music, the effects and everything in it is simply relaxing and enjoyable. this app sure is good best to it's extent if i were to declare it as.
austin routt : i am not a big fan of mobile gaming, to the point that the entire platform usually irritates me. but i have had this game for years and have made a specific effort to download it each time i get a new phone. i don't get bored with it and stop playing after a while. the team has managed to show heart and care in the design of the game from soundtrack to atmosphere down to the mechanics. it's not a complicated game at all. it is just genuinely good
abdullah ahmed : awesome graphics, music and controls, i like how the music is calm and the gameplay is classic and the graphics are attractive. it's never a waste of time, the ads are worth it as it's not too much nor it's long, if you want my suggestion, alto is perfect to be on your phone.
sarah allison : this game is entertaining! it provides for a very relaxed experience with beautiful visuals. it plays calm music and even provides a free mode where you can just snowboard forever on the smooth terrain. you can play it anywhere without internet and almost ad free! this game is very unique even including a photo mode to show off your cool tricks!
amari lockett : alto's adventure is a great game for 6-12 years. the game is really fun because you get to runaway from elders (that's what they're called in the game) and get points for doing tricks on your snowboard.
shade_takeshi : i love this game, its hard to get the hang of it, but thats the point right? a game thats too easy isn't fun, and it challenges your reflexes and reaction time. the amazing sounds and endless part gives it infinite replay-ability. i have recommended this app to all of my friends and i will continue to do so.
chloe seaman : i cannot even begin to tell you how great this game is! ever since i playing it on an iphone at the verizon store, i was in love with it. this game is so relaxing, calming, smooth ( there have been no lags) the art style is chill, you don't get blown to pieces with ads, and overall it really fun. i have to say though, playing though the night in the game is a bit difficult and elders are too but anyways, thank you for making this game!
shahidur rahman : very good app. you can pass lots of time by playing it
fabian garcia : okay so i play with the music volume turned all the way down and it's soooo calming and it's a great game to play if you just wanna pass time or if you wanna get into a long session. 10/10 amazing gameplay, i would totally advertise for this game and alto's odyssey, and speaking of advertising, the ad-free is totally worth the price!
conlaed o cearbhallain : beautiful game, just finished it, i can finally finish my work now
agna thalakkal : it's like a really good game. mostly similar to alto's odyssey. it's very addictive and and although it has similar concepts to other games, those other games give me a headache. alto's adventure and alto's odyssey are both really good games. they have this thing were the weather and time change which i haven't seen in other games and it's quite fun having it change. although in night i can't see some rocks but it's okay. a really good game
salmaa's thoughts : the best game to relax to. it isn't the type of game you play to win but rather to enjoy. super chill, beautiful visuals, smooth animation and overall perfect. would recommend. it's a stunning game.
emmanuel odiowa : the game is fabulous but my problem is that, sometimes the controls freezes when i've played like three or four times straight and when it does, i can't jump the rocks or perform a flip... can fix that glitch please
lily tissot : this is honestly one of the best mobile games i've ever played. the art and scenery are breathtaking, the gameplay is fun, and i don't feel forced to be addicted to the game. the ads don't bother me each time i finish a round (unlike most free mobile games) and zen mode is probably the smartest feature i've ever seen in a game (though it'd be nice to have a tutorial on how to find it; i had to look it up). this is a beautiful, non-addictive game that i recommend to everyone.
sandra wong : all right it deserves best iphone game award it gets depressing when you fail over and over but the phrases help with the pain,i wish i wasn't so busy so i can play some more.and hope i get to try snowboarding irl in the future i like the new improvements,perhaps there could be a few seconds to admire the view, every few seconds maybe? or a break or cool down if we've been playing for a while
life's a shade of gray : one of the most pleasing arcade games i have played. the visuals are so relaxing in this game it will relieve you off all stress. especially if you play this after returning home from your work.
nick m : i'm having such an amazing time playing this. one subtle idea for the zen mode, while in zen mode it'd be great ot have a idle or auto mode - to make the boarder jump over dangers or jump rails. such an amazing asmr waiting to happen!
mmm, me : this game is just great. it's an endless runner, at the end of the day. but it's still quite unique! the graphics and music and general atmosphere of the game is amazing! it's quite simple, but in a charming, good way. i especially like that you can do backflips. there's very few ads, so that's quite nice! there's even a zen mode where you can't die! overall, it's quite a nice experience. i could play this for an hour or two a day! i'd recommend it. (obviously.)
radhe sanskriti atray : it's very nice game and i have a great experience in it i love this came and also it has a feature that if they are in the online mode we can just turn off the data and play the game in offline mode it also works very smoothly even offline. plus the view and the background music is so relaxing and soothing that we just leave everything annoying it is a great and cool game all should download it.
reyaashri suresh : ads are very common in games ,so even though it has ads it doesn't bother ........btw it's fantastic , the graphics the sound the change in day and night are just so aesthetic and relaxing. if you want a game to relax but also interesting this is just for you . i just downloaded it a few days ago and i'm loving it
imdiyas ahamed : fantastic sound design, great time killer and may help to asses our own attention span . if want little bit easier, then there is another mode where you can simply enjoy the game. fabulous.
j k : most addicting game ever!! once i started playing, i couldn't get off. i totally recomend the download. its easy, but hard. u get me? like, its easy to jump and flip, but its hard to get really far. its an overall great game, and whoever is reading this should get it. betcha you cant guess who the best gamer is. look back at the 2nd word :)
a google user : a very fantastic app, hats off to the team behind it . the changing of the landscape and the sunset and sunrise are just very amazing features in it. i would recommend everyone,who is in search of an arcade game, to please download it. you will have fun.
dakota whitford : this app is just amazing! the gameplay is simple to understand but not boring, and the graphics are the best i have seen from any game i have played; computer, phone and tv! i don't play many games, and therefore don't ever review them, but this game is a must! love this game, the music, graphics and gameplay makes it a wonderful game to play when stressed out! 5 stars and well deserved!
rajdeep deb : really simple game but an awesome experience
g. w. : i love this game! to some people it might get kinda boring after a while. but for me it's just very peaceful, also i really love the graphics. it doesn't really involve that much thinking, just kinda a simple layed back game, very soothing and peaceful. if you're looking for something to just kinda take you away, i recommend it. also you definitely get a much better experience with headphones or earbuds. i love playing this game, really does good for your soul lol.
tom4x : very relaxing and soundtrack too amazing
john mercado : i have been playing this since 2017 but i am still mesmerized by the minimalistic but gorgeous visuals and the peaceful music. overall the game is a 10/10. the graphics, gameplay and controls are great. experience is a huge bonus on this game.
ognjen nedeljov : and thats how the game for phones are made. its not pay to play. you got stuff to buy, but you dont need it. ads are only when you want to continue game. and zen mode with headphones, fantastic! this is the first time i give 5 stars. excellent job and thank you for the most nicest and relaxing game! all the best in other games! cheers
sean wang : alto does exactly what it set out to do: serve up a minimalistic core game loop with a distinct and atmospheric presentation, even including a zen mode to fully emphasize its aesthetics. nothing much to say other than it's a great application to de-stress with: just don't get bored with its simple gameplay.
din mamma : it's calm and beautiful but still exciting and fast enough for adrenaline! very nice! it has a game mode called "zen mode" which is very calming since it removes the adrenaline game mechanisms. the music is good but sadly i do not use my phone speaker because it's annoying on trains or local places so i do not know much about it, all in all very nice
adrija dey : beautiful this is such an amazing game with spot on aesthetic graphics and with the music this game is just mind blowing and not to forget the zen mode, which is relaxing and refreshing. i was in search of such an aesthetically pleasing game for a long time. glad to find this piece of masterpiece.
a k : this game is fin to play in the car!very good quality game!
samir alam : the graphics is realistic.
ghostpuppolter : addictive and very fair, i've got to say i don't play many mobile games but this is really fun its very enjoyable and whenever i lose at it i feel like it was my own fault and not the games which can't be said for other games which are pay to win. while you can pay to get better gear in this game you can unlock it all without ever spending a cent. overall fun and a great time killer.
christian lewis : amazing game. i can't stop playing it. the devs crammed in a surprising amount of depth for a game that essentially uses one button. music and visuals are on point as well. turning off the ads is only two bucks, and this game is worth at least that.
aditya yadav : loving the experience..... i don't know for how much long i have been playing ... the music ,the alluring veiw, the sound of person falling .... it's just damn hypnotic.... kind of attracting and the zen mode is mind blowing. great game . but the ads don't revive alto and not does give 500 coins.
mohammed rouijel : that was the best game in term of gameplay and graphism
riley c : this game is beautifully designed, and the graphics make it so satisfying to play. i really enjoy the simple nature of it, and the relaxing music that the game has! zen mode is loads of fun, because if you get knocked over, you can just continue snowboarding!
seema shahid : it's a wonder, what a great artist can do, with the abstraction of graphics api's. timeless and contemporary design with heartwarming music. i am out of words to describe this beautiful piece of interactive art.
existence is pain and i am screaming : fantastic. i have adhd, leading to me not being able to watch youtube videos without being bored. no other games are good to keep my fingers working due to ads, so the zen mode is great for me. it's in the name- it's zen.
mitchell cusimano : beautiful music track, calming and fun. addictive but in a good way. no cons to make you want to buy coins to get a character. you just race down a mountain, jumping and trying to build as much speed and do as many tricks as you can. fantastic game.
fatin_bunbun's : someone help me!!! i do really addicted on this game i do install it just now and played it, it just wow and amazing seriously !! recommended for all and it's really good too to play when your headphones or earphones on and play this game peacefully with cool music, really loved it. the graphics looks like a real art, really stunning and graceful. love the scenery so much and also the controls really easy trust me it's easy and tricky too but it's really fun and relaxing !!!
jess dawn : this game and the other (alto's odyssey ) are the best. while others play candy crush i played these. i really recommend it. and if they could bring new characters and tricks (more than back flip only) that would be great.
gio : i really like this game, its pretty simple and relatively easy once you get the hang of it. i actually prefer this version rather that alto's odyssey, due to the fact that its challenges are easier to complete because there are less obstacles. ;)
lurch logan : absolutely stunningly beautiful game. a piece of art in video game form and easy to maneuver. though the different obstacles & beautiful scenery coming at me at such a fast pace made me dizzy & semi nauseous. it's sad because i really could've delved into this game for hours on end. the music is relaxing as well. keep doing what you're doing noodlecake studios!! 5/5
nadine bruno : another beautiful adventure with alto & friends, don't miss out on this amazing fun game, challenging slip & glide fast ride down slops scoring high points along the way by pulling off a few flips & tricks!! love the beautiful scenes backdropped behind with a wonderful soundtrack, super chill, wicked game, i love alto characters, this game rocks!!
dog in a scarf : i really love this game it can help you go through boredom,i also love the zen mode but it's more challenging when it's the normal mode,i also think that you should add more characters to run from other than the horseman,and please add other bridges, but love the game!!!keep up the good work,
kamaniya m. : this game is a damn good and relaxing game. smooth graphics and enchanting music makes it very awesome. however, missions are a bit hard to achieve but you can always skip it by watching ads. still, i love this game so much.
francis opena : overall the game is very calming to play. the controls are pretty simple, soundtrack is zen, the graphics is soft to the eyes, and the enemy who chases you every now and then doesn't feel much like a threat but still maintains it's objective to make you go faster and make you excited still.
disamorforming : the atmosphere of this game is all about taking a step back and relaxing, pondering the moment. even if the mechanics are simple, the game is as far from boring as it gets, and every sound, note and background piece is there for you to sit down and enjoy the ride. i cant wait to play this game in a us on a rainy night as i slowly drift to sleep.
casually relyt : i'm sure that you guys won't ever read this, but i have really bad panic attacks and they have been getting worse. the music in your game, i just put it on and pop in my headphones and just drift away. it is literally the most serene and relaxing thing i've ever heard and the gameplay itself is super simple but super relaxing. no lie, it's gotten me through some really really dark times and i'm super grateful to you guys. thank you all so much.
jonathan lalhmangaihzuala : been over 3 years since i picked this game up and i'm yet to find a game i love half as much. i almost cried when i finished all the levels. there's something absolutely magical about this game, like reading an enid blyton novel. my only request to the developers is to add more levels, alto's odyssey just doesn't have the charm of the original.
thomas symes : watching others play this game i was intrigued, being a student i needed a game to play underneath a table and this was perfect, the controls are super easy, the graphics on a samsung oled display just flew out at me and i was left feeling satisfied as it isn't a money grab whilst also being super playable and worthwhile downloading.
farhath hajra : a big fan of the game, challenges, levels, music are all too good. zen mode for this game is the best! the graphics and the synchronisation is amazing! such a soothing and realistic effect! been my favourite game since the past 4 years!
paul tony : first of all thanking the developers for providing this game free on android. i love the gameplay and each character has special characters. the levels are very interesting but i recommend to add more obstacles on the way so that it would be more interesting.
cute nightmare : the most relaxing game i have ever played to be honest the music, the weather rain thunderstorms, the sounds of snow boarding and all the night animals. i've seen people talk about ads just turn off your wifi simple then play. i also like the fact that there is a zen mode where you just chill out snowboard enjoy the scenery just it's amazing well done devs well done.
gabe leme : i just love this game so much i cannot explain it. it's so calming! its visuals are simply the best. i prefer to play on zen mode the best bcs it's sooo pretty; like when it's night and it has shooting stars, it's raining and this perfect sound track of piano is playing, it calms my thoughts so much, i really needed it. it's also really simple to play and everytime you make a mistake you revive again so you don't get pissed off, i just keep swimming in good thoughts, i really, really love it <3
latisya azara : ngl i felt frustrated the first few times i play this game cz i keep dying.. but then i discovered zen mode and after i had some good practice it's actually fun.. not to mention how relaxing it became to play on zen mode with the music and i love how everything went slowmo everytime i backflip over a chasm it's amazing and i cant stop smiling everytime that happens.. i do have a complaint however about how some rocks are just impossible to see esp during nighttime but overall i recommend.
iceofphoenix88 : where can you go wrong with alto? zen mode is relaxing, the graphics are incredible and the gameplay is silky smooth. the music is absoltuely stunning and this game deserves more attention. you can't judge it from the pictures alone. all the reviews are positive and this game has won many awards, from apple and google. there is no reason why you should not have alto's adventure and alto's odyssey installed.
trope adope : awesome game that's definitely worth putting time into. only one thing that needs improvement; there's a bug that pops up every now and again that stops you from jumping. it'll carry over to the next run but if you leave the game and come back it'll be gone.
ishan scjijfhd : the aesthetics of this game is just chef's kiss, combined with the relaxing background music, sound of the clicks, the fog-glass interface, this is a really minimalist game with not much to do with the gameplay, but i find myself staring at the screen with this game on just because the aesthetics and musics, great job
goldenfoxy523 : a nice calm game when you have nothing to do or your just feeling down. beautiful 10/10 graphics and the controls are as smooth as possible. the music is natural beautiful and calming and the sfx has a really realistic natural feel. this is one of the most calming games i have ever played.
pizza steve : very relaxing and simple, pretty much the definition of atmospheric. game has no bugs or glitches and runs pretty well on any phone. really good for just relaxing especially on long bus trips or plane trips because it requires no internet.
miadraws things : i really love this game. the regular gameplay is super fun, and the zen mode is really calming. the music is soothing, and the simplistic graphics are absolutely beautiful. the colours work with eachother super well, and over all makes the game just that much better.
lorelei zech : wow i'm speechless this game is amazing i really recommend you try it. the music made me so calm down and the feeling of being free overwhelmed my body it was amazing i love the game i recommend you try it too because it is fun game the graphics are amazing though at night time you cannot see very well so you end up running into rocks but i love that you can stop chasing the llamas and just play free. this game is amazing try it it's awesome if there was 10 stars i'd definitely give it that.
narsis tatalia : simply lovely. i did experience a bug where sometimes the jump function doesn't work as expected and i have to restart application to play perfectly again. please fix but otherwise awesome game! definitely recommended to to other players!
makanaka abushama : it is really entertaining and fun to play, the graphics and visuals are well created and the challenges are really achievable but also a bit nerve wracking as well you never want to stop playing it! i love it!!!!!!!!
hannah pfaff : i love this game! the visuals are stunning, and other than the occasional difficult challenge (proximity backflips, ugh!), this game is soothing and entertaining no matter how many times you come back to it.
darknyan gaming : i've just come back from pc because i wanted to try out some apps, and still this game astounds me. i can't really think any other way to phrase this; the game is beautiful. though i had one bug one where i died from falling on a tree an ended up just sitting in midair. plz fix.
jonathan peterson : i love this game. i got it on a whim one day since i was going on a long trip, and it occupied me for most of it. the whole trip was 20 hours long! this game is a perfect mix of soothing music beautiful landscapes, and fun gameplay with good challenges as well. i would even recommend it to people who don't normally play games (either videogames or app games) as it's very relaxing and fun.
courtney klaft : 5 stars is not enough. its amazing and challenging in a good way its one of those games that doesnt get so impossibly hard that you hate it but is just difficult enough to keep you from walking away. the graphics and game play are phenomenal and just what i was looking for. thank you so much. :d
johannes muller : alto's winter wonder world is beautiful and versatile. the graphics looks natural even it's design is minimalistic. i have only some improvements i would consider to implement. reduce the main menu and make the optimal track more visible with coins.
digitalnaf : great. simple and fun to play. i find it relaxing. the look, feel and sound all just work. ad's only appear once a run is over (occasionally) but can easily and quickly closed. no big deal. i highly recommend it.
pen life : this game is the true meaning of stress killing.. everything, the atmosphere, sound all are sooo good.. for office workers this is a 'must play' game.. finally thank you devs.. along with that : if you find the levels challenging, you can go to zen mode because we can respawn just by touching the screen on the spot where you fell
elias hirst : i have anxiety and depression. i downloaded this game to help me relax and it works, the music and scenery is very soothing. i highly recommend it if you just need something to help you wind down, i just play it on zen mode to help me when i'm feeling anxious =^^=
galuh fadilla rizaldi : so smooth. you guys should make another version that has no obstacle. so people can just watch it until they fall asleep. me personally enjoyed watch and play alto when i'm bored. but i quit the game when i hit the obstacle. i play this to relax, not to compete. but, i think you guys know yout audience. i'm just one of many. by the way if you read this, thank you for your time.
elitefourdave aman : this game is so perfect its so relaxing and addictive but i have only one problem in my device its a bit laggy and i cant jump even when im pressing the screen i think this is a bug can you guys fix it and one last thing i can suggest in the game is to make the weathers adjustable so that we can choose the weather we want to be in the backround without changing
kaia harrison : this game is amazing, it's one of the few good games i can find that aren't filled with ads, the visuals are beautiful and the music is incredible with headphones. i am definitely going to play alto's odyssey and i would absolutely donate.
v -a : after a long tiring day, or after playing action games, i needed something to relax, i was searching for games that is simple, good graphics, relaxing, etc., this game is the best choice for me. i really love the day and night cycle and i really enjoyed the thunderstorm with realistic sound effects.
mantisman : i typically do not like games like these but this was quite the surprise, it only shows ads when you want to see them and the gameplay is enjoyable and relaxing. some of the task are a bit tedious but i cannot fault the game for that. the visuals are cute and i must get my precious felipe, speaking of which. the array of characters is quite nice, each one with their own unique traits. this isn't on a review scale but the merch store is something i haven't really seen in a mobile game.
arpit lahoti : let me say one thing, this is the game that just makes you feel calm and just makes you remember your happy memories when you visited some place. those soft musical notes, those soft crackling noise when you just touch and hover up in the ether when you touch the stones, those soft sound from board and ice and those intermittent lightning punctuating the night, i can go on and on. this game is totally awesome, and i can't compromise on uninstalling this application :)
ella : great game. it's simplistic but very fun and great to past the time. the music is lovely. i only have found 1 problem which is sometimes when i start the game i can't jump so i have to exit out and go back in until it lets me jump. though it may just be a phone problem my touch-sensor thing isn't always the best.
barry beasts : this game is fun and i love playing on long car rides. the next part is to the editors of the game: did you know that your icon is impossible? the person doing the flip would have to be facing left, not right; the person would land the flip backwards to his/her normal position.
hazel baines : it's a really calm and relaxing game, especially in zen mode. i love chaining together long trick combos and trying to achieve the goals. also, the graphics are beautiful and the controls are easy to use.
random stuff : the music is relaxing and the gameplay has a nice one handed feel. it does contain a lot of ads but i normally just turn off wifi and tuen it back on once i'm done playing. would highly recommend. very enjoyable.
river perry : this game is beautiful. the art style is simplistic yet perfect the premise is also simple but its not the entirety of why you should play this game the goal is to catch as many llamas as you can seems unoriginal right? but thats only a side ideal at best. the amazing sound effects, the gorgeous music, and the fun yet calming gamplay is perfect for a mobile device even if you are like me and dont play many mobile games, please give this game a try you wont regret it.
david rickard : this game is a joy to play. the microtransactions are not required to beat the game, but the one-time "no ads" purchase is totally worth it. it's impressive just how engaging and fun it is with such a simple control scheme.
hakimo matata : sometimes game got stuck. still, graphics/controls/music are top, so i continued playing til the end, level 60. ads are annoying but can be removed for some euros. a great game to come back to again and again.
mayur patil : can you please introduce background music like alto odessey in this one also? one of the best ! i this game bcoz: 1. easy to play for offline purpose. 2. soothing and calming background music. 3. best is zen mode where alto goes on endless journey. no fear of losing, death or collecting points. totally love it.
polina sholeninova : i'm not a gamer at all. but i admire alto's adventure. smooth graphics, simple control, peaceful melody, pleasant colors and calm pace. deep respect and thanks to the developers! the game is fun and relaxing in the same time.
matreintsherde : ads arent very instrusive, and the minimalist design (both gameplay and aesthetics) is on point. i originally thought ads were optional because of how few i saw, but it really isn't that bad. it's not a voodoo game, after all
thomas brotherton : extremely well designed. would recommend. developers: i'm experiencing an issue on my galaxy s9, whenever filipe activates the wing suit the game stalls for a brief second, which can easily result in a death. otherwise the game seems flawless :)
rory hart : fantastic game in every way. you can relax and play casual or try to beat your high score and go competitive. developers can we have a portrait mode for it. (kind of like the google no internet game). maybe a bit easier because you can't see as far ahead idk. pls do this it would be fantastic
prodthereal : ran into this game, installed it today and played it for a couple of hours and i must say, probably the most relaxing game i've ever come across! the scenes are soothing, the music is peaceful and melodic and the gameplay is smooth and the design and overall look of the game is just chill and amazing! love this game!
victor knight : great game but theres a few bugs here and there when you crash. i hit a rock just right and landed in a chasm, when i paid the coins to get back up nothing happened... because i was also stuck in a chasm. overall a great game though!
eir olsen : best game ever...!! it was calming, zen mode is awesome.. i always wanted to go snowboarding.. at night under the moonlight... shooting star and all.. and this game gave me the feelings... and it's awesome.. but i wish we could go snowboarding with our friends.. you know like an online match(and zen mode would be us snowboarding with no distraction)
dipsana roy : this game deserves 5 out of 5. lovely, breathtaking sceneries, soul touching music, smooth animations, awesome graphics and easy controls. what's left? i think everyone should try this game at least once.
a google user : hands down one of the most beautiful games of all time. i spend hours (especially in zen mode) and it complete soothes my mind. gameplay, graphics, music - just one word - beautiful! a big shout out to the devs for their brilliant effort. thanks guys <3
vikram jeet : at first it seemed like a normal average game but endless mode feature made me fall in love with this. i just loved the animation of sunrise, sunset, rain and moon night and music is very calming.. i am glad you gave the feature of endless surfing, just you and mountains. good ,excellent work.
stephen greiner : this game is one of the best mobile games i have played, with beautiful artwork,phenominal ambient music, and great sound design. all of this combined with a simple idea and gameplay, it makes for an excellent game with near flawless execution.
friend last : i love the way this game relaxes my soul deeply if u are looking for a game well here it is i never had a one thing i can say my favourite but well guess my boring journey ends here and my new adventure starts with alto's. :) and u did a master piece and please keep it up with the music and the graphics it's spectacular and when i say this don't stop making it more extravagant :) so that i and we will keep up with ur updates ;) enjoyed it loved it greeeeeeeat music with flawless graphics!
atharva dixit : the best game ever played. great physics, idea and overall performance of the game is just great. but one thing i encountered that as a beginner, ads were not a problem. but the more you play, the more often the ads will pop up. this is the only problem i have, otherwise i love this game.
shelby hawley : it is really hard for me to get addicted to a game, but you've done it. the day/night cycle is beautiful, and the occasional gentle rain mixed with the stunning music is incredible. well done on the graphics. they are simple yet complex in the way only few can accomplish.
agassi joel : i love this game. this is super cool and stress relief. the graphics are crispy and nice. nice visualisations. keep giving us more games of this kind. the colors background music themes are awesome. best time pass game .
naura tuhfa : it runs smoothly on my phone. no annoying ads between every level or in the middle of the game. it also somehow very soothing, especially the rain part. the sound that it make when you tap something is kinda soothing as well. great game.
cjchicken : controls are simple, the graphics are beautiful, the music is beautiful, and the challenges are challenging enough to be fun but not so challenging that they can't be completed. the while idea of this game is honestly beautiful.
nate : a very beautiful, simple game, with an amazing art style and simple controls. the music is peaceful yet adventurous, and the game is jam packed with cool characters and items.
sam more : just relaxing game, great ost and the changing of day to night just deal so realistic. if u r finding a game to relax i would prefer this one. every thing is good about this game just one thing i dislike is the ads that pop up while playing, but when u will start playing u will not bother about the ads. such a great game.
liam paes : i really really love this game. i only have 1 suggestion. could you make a mode in which alto just goes down a mountain with no obstacles or anything. you just admire the beauty of the game world and relax while listening to the soundtrack. i would really love that as well. i love the beauty of the map and the simplicity of the game and the soundtrack.
ava gabbert : amazing game! super fun, really relaxing. the zen mode is so awesome! it really helps with anxiety and since everyone is going through stress right now, i highly recommend. you will not regret getting this game. beautiful music, and the sunrises and sunsets are stunning. great job overall.
miracle abaye : i'll tell you why i gave you five star. story boarding. clean and a unique user interface, nice music playing in the background. the weather seasons. oh i love the weather seasons. selection of different characters. i just love this game.
kevon tadiwa : i have no complaints with the game at all. it's a satisfying game, tho i hate it when i do awesome back flips and slow down hence crashing. hope it also improve on having front flips or something. the sound is also great
sabrina mcdonnell : fantastic game, i love everything about it. the one and only thing i wish it had was an option to disable nighttime, because with my job i have a lot of free time but i'm outside in the sun, and the glare makes it impossible to see during in-game night
pratham arc : loved the game. absolutely loved it. made me soooo excited for the sequel as well. very smooth. very comfortable. nothing that's unnecessary. very relaxing. accompanied by beautiful music and stunning animation and graphics. really deserves 5 stars.
abhishek vishwakarma : one of the best graphics in such a small size game. loved the minimalist graphics. but the best part is the background melody. i mean sometimes i just play this game to just get some sound sleep and sweet dreams. want to give six stars to this game.
hari ch : by far the best game i have ever played although many ads ruin the game. noodlecake studios did a fantastic job on this game and the music is just too good and relaxing.if you are a stressed person i recommend this game to you. the textures are also really good.overall this game is perfect for all ages and i really think noodlecake should remove the ads and i recommend you to buy this game.
ayusuman paikray : one of the best relaxing casual games. i spend my free time playing this game. the game is with limied features but its visuals are really interesting. another special about this game is its music sounds which are really so good and also relaxing.
aurora_boketto : it's fun, challenging and rewarding^^ the more u play the better u get! and it's helped be a great distraction from all the bad things going on currently great game!! only thing i found hard were the backflips , but he faster u get the easier they become :)
infotechz : may this game and the developers live for about a zillion years, this game is just ''unexplainably'' relaxing. the music is soo stunning!! the graphics are incredibly soothing, just everything about this game is perfect and awesome!! even the alto's odyssey is the same!! thank you for this game.
suhana _ : relaxing game. the music's great, the graphics are great and the controls are easy. i thought i would install it in my not-so-smooth tablet. i expected it to lag or crash but it didn't! i love it!
eleanor rose : calming, beautiful, and the zen mode is great for play. i love the soundtrack and graphics, and it is easy to understand how to use. the ads can get a little annoying, but does not ruin the gameplay at all.
serenity canales : i havent gotten too far but decently far. and it is so relaxing yet challenging. there is a story yet it looks so simple. i honesty just live this game and it isnt full of ads unless you want some coins or need to revive him but i usually dont unless i got angry i lost
paranormal : the game is good. ads are a bit obnoxious but it's great nonetheless. the graphics are quite pleasant and the game itself is quite calming and a good way to pass time. one thing i'd like is a more intense song that you hear when you're getting chased. but other than that i don't have any problems.
deadlyjaguar89 : really fun, it's the same, just running but the challenges can be difficult so it's not bad at all. i always play it on the bus to school because i don't have mobile data so i can only use non internet stuff. this is really good and you should install it.
seb skelton-foord : this game is so relaxing!! playing with headphones really does make a huge difference, as the music played in the background really seems to have an impact on your playing experience!! 100% would reccomend!
prashant bhandari : use headphones........ it's a whole different experience with headphones on. the graphics are really good.... kinda peaceful. best upgrade you can get here is 'wingsuit'. i'll recommend save coins from the start... don't upgrade magnet time or hover time. just unlock wingsuit and play.
iqra ahmed pandit : now this is what i call a proper game . proper controls , great graphic and relaxing like 10 minutes ago i downloaded it and from the start i loved it . just a small tip bring new maps and pls let us have some characters for free by coins in the game
brian torres : this is the most relaxing game i've ever played especially the endless mode. i've been playing it for quite a while now. it is easy-to-play and user-friendly. the graphics is great. it's simple yet awesome. go ahead and try!
mahesh thule : best endless arcade game! the graphics and visuals are magical. the best part of games like this is that they don't want the user to think more and more about the gameplay ,i.e zero complexity of the gameplay. soundtrack of this game is soothing. true master piece.
bhargav patel : as an illustrator myself, i love the work on minimal aesthetics on scenery. these soothing pastel colors filling each and every frame with aesthetic imagery really prove a deep influence in our mind. can't describe the beauty of zen mode. it's just beyond words. that soulful music, i can listen endlessly. and the freedom of carelessness that the music offers, makes me play the zen mode for hours and hours. really in love with both of your games, guys! hope to see another installment...
david ickes : from the music, to the game play, to the visual aesthetics, this games dose it all so well. they tool the original altos adventure & some how made it even better. can't get enough of this game, i love it.
azizah abdul rahman : i love the game the music is beautiful and the background was epic. i don't like the adventure mode cuz it needs to do so much stuff and zen mode is a next level stuff! i rate it: (drumroll and stop) 5 stars! (even tho it has brutal fail)!
shivam pardeshi : nice music, relaxing gameplay. i always play this game when i am most stressed. it works like stress-relieving charm. it is also one of the best timekiller. nice. love from me noodlecake studios. please make more games like this (alto's odyssey is a great game too). please don't let the negative comments affect you. i have a small tablet of 1 gb ram,but still this game runs smoothly. i really recommend you to try it first.
shrey : this is just gaming gold . you can play for hours and still not be bored . this is game is very relaxing. but still has a high skill ceiling , making sure you can grind points and do the countless objectives given in this game and still find room to improve and beat your previous high score . p.s. (for the devs) if you go too fast the powerups dont work and u cant collect coin
8f48vinayakprathap : i really like this game. one of the most relaxing game i've played. all the animation..the background music makes the game more good. no ads. which is good. the time change in the game you the morning,noon, evening and night and the raining effect.. thunderstorms....this game is really cool. i love to this game.
adjamaja minsmog : the game is pretty easy. but the actual way of enjoying the game is to turn music off and sound effects at max volume. just listening to your character ski in the snow is just very nice.
mxchii : this has been my favorite game since 2018 or something around that; i love it, but i erased my phone because i had wayyyy to much things... i also accidentally also deleted alto... still my favorite game although i'm typing this in 2020 (c a r o n a timee) i really recommend this game 5 star game period. nice, calming but cool music you can listen to while you play, also an endless game but you can stop whenever you feel like! skins, music, landscaping (different types of places), fun, etc.
lee gowans : awesome game, can get a little frustrating in later levels as some of the objectives are kinda random and impossible to predict. otherwise awesome graphics, great controls, soundtrack is perfect and has a lot of longevity
sl. space : very nice graphics, smooth the only problem is, it is personal opinion no multiple player and less places but games play is good very beautiful creative and tasking game, sound effects is relaxing and the game playing it very attractive for girls, when you play this around of some people, thay all will look at in to your phone, i like this game very much
i don't know k : it's absolutely gorgeous and the music so calming, it's a little hard to get the hand of at the beginning but once you get a hand of it it's amazing, and zen mode is absolutely amazing, and i just love everything about it!!
akshit chaturvedi : a great stress reliever! i've played all sorts of innovative games but in none of them did i find music which works in tandem with the game . the perfect combination of music and video makes this game all the more fun .
candra wijaya : play it when u feel upset, i hope it's help. i already downloaded this game for a several times. i love this games, i enjoyed the beautiful graphics and the wonderful soundtrack. hope u will make more game like this, or maybe you can make one app which contains alto's odyssey too. so we don't need to download it again. i'm so sorry for my bad english, but i hope u understand what i meant. thanks...
ian james : a very relaxing game to play. the graphics & sound effects are top notch. i do find the ads a little intrusive but it doesn't detract from the overall quality. one of the better games out there, at least for a non-gamer like myself.
sebastian voinea : this game is amazing!!! i love the characters, the graphics, the music, the sound, everything! i also like that the game has no ads except for the ones that give you in-game things. the only thing that will make this game 6/5 stars is if you can buy characters with coins.
kiefer swistak : this game is the most beautiful game i've ever played. i've probably taken around 20 screenshots so far and i haven't even had it for 24 hours. the zen mode is really good to practice in. i would recommend that before the main challenges to get your skill up. amazing game!
kostiskat : i have been playing this game for months now. what can i say.. the gameplay experience is exceptional, not hard to understand at all. secondly, the hd graphics really add something to the game. i like the chill music and the night mood in the game.. it makes me stay up until late. finally, the controls could not be more simple. all you need to do is tap your screen. but i am not going to ruin your experience. go ahead and give it a try for yourself.
tadrushi jani : one of my most favourite games! have been playing for years. beautiful graphics, wonderful music and perfect amount of challenges and tasks. it is a great game.
narwalice __________ : oh my gosh, this game is amazing, it so peaceful, i love the feature of the zen mode and how you can just go without having to do any tasks or anything.. just peaceful. this game is so beautiful as well whoever made the designs and art needs a raise. i played 5 minutes of the game and it's already my favorite ever,. i'm gonna sare this with my friends.
valeria godoy : i love this game. it's beautiful, magic, easy to play and so relaxing, the music is unforgettable and touching and the sceneries are a piece of art. actually you can't describe it only with words, you have to try it!
kimberly rutherford : super calming, very pretty, and had great music and atmosphere. i lobe when its raining in the game its so beautiful and its like an actual rainy day. and zen mode is good if you die a lot or dpnt want the sound of things you hit to disturb the peaceful music and weather sounds of the game. its a very good game i highly recomemd it if you like music, pretty things, and weathery things. and as you play the game days actually pass and you see sunset and sunrise and the moon and weather changes too
muhamad fathan giovani : amazing arttttt!!!! but there was a bug, that when i wanted to take a photo, the gameplay turned blue on the screen, and only the sound. i have to restart the level first, then return to normal. thank you for creating this game
timothy womble : though i tend to avoid "endless runner" games, this one caught my eye and proved to be surprisingly good. the controls are simple and well-done and the overall atmosphere can be very therapeutic. a remarkable game.
jksonblkson : very nostalgia inducing and calming, amazing minimalistic graphics and great sound design, but it doesnt run very well on my phone, i get about 20 fps max. it recently released on xbox, too. i just wish it was cheaper...
aditya yagic : i have played so many games before, which have action, adventure, etc. but alto's adventure is best stress removal game. i like it's sounds, zen mode and diffrent type of tasks at every level.
eli davis : it's a beautiful little rider game where you can do backflips and smaller tricks to get boosts the art is really nice and the music is relaxing and i'm a big fan of zen mode as well as constantly trying to best my high score!
mooniversal 3875592847 : amazing! the game is sooo cool i love the music. it relaxed me so much! love it. no annoying ads. simple concept and controls, smooth animations and gameplay. good graphics.
flo's foods : what can i say? this game is perfect! the visuals and music are everything and i really enjoyed it. i would maybe give you an option to buy the other characters with in-game money but overall this app is one of my favourites :)
dinkesh jain : it's just perfect!!! relaxing, non addictive, wholesome, challenging and everything i can think of. and a big kudos to the graphic designers. just epic graphics!! totally satisfied.
ryan zellmer : great game, very well donr. continues to be interesting longer than you would expect. one of the few games i actually like the sound on for. free with minimal ads that do not get annoying.
vivek ambekar : this game came into my life when i was going through depression. i felt so relaxed playing this.l especially zen mode. the music is soothing and peaceful. the message i took from playing in zen mode is no matter what you always have second chances. if you fall pick yourself up dust yourself off and move on. nothing is more beautiful than journey itself not even the destination. zen mode is all about this. this helped me gain my self confidence back. helped me through my tough times. thank you.
chubi adah : this is the best game ever. it was very difficult for me to rate this game because my eyes were glued to alto's adventure. the game would be better if there were many more characters, and also that you don't unlock bought buy them with coins.
ierfal imposter : i love the app i love the zen mode i love the llamas i basically love everything. one thing i think could be changed is something about the zen mode where you can add llamas so you're still on the objective/point of the game. it's very calming, and whenever i get bored i play this. i love the men you run past when you get far off in the game. keep up the great work!
lucas steer : beautiful graphics and effects. beautiful music and effects. fun for gameplay, interesting unlocks with enough depth and good pacing. really solid fun game that can be quite calming and fun to play or you can try and go for extra tricks to make it more intense.
arjun chang : amazing game... but character goes out of screen sometimes when using wingsuit... also would be better if we could change locating of wingsuit icon... other than that it's very relaxing and enjoyable.
aasritha vegesena : this a very nice game. no complex rules or controls , good controls (fluid like) , amazing bgm. basically amazing, all in one. so relaxing and no ads.so basically you can replace your therapist with the zen mode in this game
idk fitz : i love this game, the simplistic art style rly hit different, the music and sound effects are on point, also it's good for passing the time. this game rly puts you at ease and completely removes any built up stress.:)
nammavar kamal haasan : this is one of the beautiful game i have ever played. and i love its simplicity. i had a bad day and my friend recommended me to play this game at zen mode at night. i just grabbed my headphones and played for 30 mins in zen mode and i was so relaxed. i always play at zen mode to get relaxed. i purchased the adless version so ads wont disturb me. its a great game.
tang corporations : it's just beautiful. amazing atmosphere and music, plus intuitive gameplay mechanics and difficulty spikes. everything that this game excels at is improved upon withvthe sequel, alto's odyssey.
jhino : pretty easy to deal with the ads, just turn the wifi off and voila! no ads. the game itself is really good as well the sounds, graphics, and animation, really calming game...
saptarshi sarkar : this is one piece if art rather a game. it's really time killing and soothing. one can play it on a relaxing mood or even take it as a challenge. the developers have done a great job. thanks.
drake brooks : absolutely love it. the visuals and soundtrack are stunning. very simple to play, too. this, and alto's odyssey, are both phenomenal on that alone.
holly hedgecock : noodlecake studios is the best mobile game dev, constantly making great games like this. i have played adventure and odyssey and they are both great. from their great grahics and relaxing gameplay, alto's odyssey and adventure are the reason i still play mobile games. also more games. these games are one of few mobile masterpieces.
gavin schneider : about the only game (along with odyssey) that stays on my phone for longer than 2 days before i get bored and remove it. it takes about a week, but reinstall every 6-9 months for a while. pretty good, seeing that i'm not really a gamer.
noivern77 : i came across this game because i was bored of pay to win games. i just searched up relaxing games and this was the first result. when i played it, it was the best mobile game had, or will ever play. its just so relaxing and fun, not too many adds, nobody destroying your base and theres a zen mode. the graphics are beautiful the music is so emmersive, and me and my dad love this game. its such a great time killer and with altos odessy also an amazing game, i think theres no reason not to get them
river : i love this game and i was overjoyed when i saw that there was another part to 'alto's odyssey' so o installed it right away. this game never ceases to surprise me with new challenges, goals and adventures. this game is so good and i love it so much and it makes me feel so much better after a hard day!
s. c : it's hard to find a perfect game. and yet, this game touched my soul. the music beautiful and calming, the graphics simple yet remarkable, and the gameplay smooth and easy. absolutely loved it. 5/5
mr. mobile : i personally find the the game quite difficult cumming from me that's a big compliment. i do suggest one up date where there is a mode where you launch off a ramp and go as far as you can while doing as much tricks as you can and you can buy stuff such as a hang glider and turbo jets please consider this.
moss : this is a gorgeous game. the gameplay is simple but intuitive. the music is really nice, and it has a zen mode which is really good for chilling. would definitely recommend
ivy helven : i've been playing this game for a while now and one time when i played it in front of my siblings, they were all interested to play it as well (on my phone). that's how addicting and fun this game is to say the ads showtime is also bearable which i'm very much thankful for btw. i just love the aesthetic this game has, it's simple to use as well! this app has helped me with calming my stress and anxiety, highly recommended. also, i love you whoever suggested the zen-mode, seriously satsifying
hj_records : im a person who has anxiotey and this game really helps me to relax and i enjoy playing it when im in the car of even at home the first time i saw this game was at the apple store and i couldnt get my hands off of the device it was calm relaxing playable and it made me enjoy also the backround is so bueatifull and the choice of music is great i hope to see another game again!
donavin overcast : amazing.... i have played nothing like this. the simplicity but yet beauty that this game offers and the gameplay is almost the same every time but then a new obstacle shows up and keep you coming back for more
xi aomi : fantastic game. calming atmosphere, lovely music and sounds. no mandatory goals or daily bonusses, but with some built-in fair challenges if you want to get new characters or improve your skills.
danielle stanley : i love this game. it's really simple and super relaxing. the controls don't always work like they should, causing a crash but most of the time it's fine. beautiful graphics and nice music too.
aidan downey : very relaxing and asteticly beautiful game.
mitali roy : this game is fantastic with an alpine-themed indie-type graphics. i would feel relaxed when i would plug in my earphones and play the game in darkness. it would be better if you add more snowboarders and daily quests rewarding coins.
captures in time : this mobile game is one of the best mobile games i've ever played. it's non-addicting, super peaceful yet very fun. the ads are non-intrusive and it's zen mode is one of my favorite features of it. i'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a break from loud mobile games. keep up the great work!
ed lin : one of the best games i have played. it has simple controls, clean simple graphics, and the concept is easy to understand. a great game if you are looking for a change. works as a great time killer too.
samuel george : i play other games but alto is just phenomenal. the music, the concept, the story... everything is just perfect. i recommend it if you've had a long day and you want to relax. it's so amazing!
amr okasha : just an overall zen experience. the grind is not excessive, the gameplay is terrific, and the music is spot on. amazing art, too! definitely recommend giving it a try.
sir warfare : oh my god!!! this is one of the best games that i' ve found. this is on top and on verge of perfection!!! this game gives me so peaceful vibes, i can't stop playing it. it reminds me about the peace in the world. such a relaxing atmosphere, great background music and simple controls. it's a dream game....
joshua productions : it's a great game but you have to pay actual money for characters instead of using the gold you get and there's no upgrade system but other than that a really good game awesome music awesome visuals the game makes it impossible to get mad at for how nice it is and i can always come back to it but the thing is it's not addicting it's really good
zero wolf : i've come back to this game time after time. part of what makes it great is honestly the simplicity combined with the visuals and music. it can be difficult, not gonna lie, but if you just want something to take your mind off things this is definitely a keeper.
-savage suki- : this game is very fun! there is no problem with it whatsoever, you can do backflips and other tricks (but no frontflips) you complete quest in the game to get gold, gold gives you chanses to revive when you crash. when you do a backflip but then a rock is right infront of you and you dont have enough time to jump, that backflip makes you invisnible for like 3 seconds- this is one of the best games i have!
soft blanket :3 : i lov the graphics! they are so good! very good on a computer! and i love the calming music! i sometimes play my own music to go with it to make my experience even better! i like the song "music for a found harmonium".
feelwandering : this game always helps me in my good and bad moods. the music is so soothing and the gameplay is indeed smooth like butter , in short it is a stress buster.
xxgalenxx : great graphics and storyline. really fun and passes time a lot of time. you jump over rocks and recollecting your deers? there's some type of animal. but great game lots a fun and overall this game. is. an. actual. gamechanger.
elite gamer siddhu : this game is highly relaxing and needs real skill to play. the best part is its zen mode where i can keep myself calm. i would like another mode in which alto just keeps sking without any obstacles in place and we get relaxed by seeing that. really nice relaxing game.
fof d : i had downloaded this game years ago and absolutely loved it. i had a samsung s5 with a great screen so it made ecerything so much nicer. sadly it dropped into the toilet to never open again so i havent played in awhile. i played odessey as soon as i could get my mothers phone (she has a galaxy note 9 so the screen was worth waiting for) and i have been playing whenever i just needed some zen. honestly one of favorite mobile games of all time!
ionut vornicescu : the bug was fixed. the game is perfect again. old rating: the game was great until yesterday. since yesterday the game crushes when i sign in with the google account. if i erase all the data, the game works until i sign in again.
karan : believe me or not, this game is an absolute kickass package. your stress will be blown away in a minute after playing this game and i'll suggest that you play it with headphones put on as the sound effects are just awesome, it feels like its actually raining and the thunder sound specially is my favourite. you must be thinking that why i'm tlaking so much about this game which isn't even that famous, but once you try it you'll get to know..
stratus exclair : it is a great game, beautiful backgrounds and musics. then the next time i opened it, it always crashes, maybe because of low battery, i don't know. pls. reply, it's a good game, it's a shame to delete a good game.
bruce chillis : please move that pause button from there. you can place it on top side of screen. everytime it gets tapped on unintentionally while i am just trying to make a jump.
kevin d : this game is very relaxing, and a great time killer too. another thing to add is that it's so gorgeous looking! the art style, the lighting, it's all great! very solid game.
andi fels : beautiful and calming. perfect for relieving anxiety. can i ask for an option in zen mode to turn off rocks, etc.? i find alto sliding along the exact curve of the earth very therapeutic and satisfying.
aryansh vikram singh : first of all thanks creator's and all the people who help to built this game . this is what i needed its all relacing like the music , animation , colours etc . i played this game first time ,the presentation is beautiful . thanks
robloxpro 67 : i can't wait to install this app again. i remember i had this app on my old zte phone since june 2016, but i lost it in the hotel while moving back to my grandma's in august 2018. i now have a samsung phone so i can't wait to play it again!
rex almighty : so so fun! i play it all the time when i'm bored, the music and sounds are so relaxing and i love each of the characters you can buy! i really recommend for anyone who just likes to pass time and relax :3
ilan penkower : the most beautiful and zen game i have ever played ever. the graphics are breathtaking, the score is absolutely beautiful, and the game itself is really relaxing. 100/10 would definitely recommend with no doubt in my mind.
emmiii : honestly a really chill game, very easy to sit back, relax, and listen to a podcast. it's not really levels although you can level up. i really love it.
alexandria hexx : it's a very calming game. zen made especially, just you and the endless mountain. the graphics are well-suited to the game, and i love the llamas! would definitely recommend.
bashir fadiga : honestly, amazing game. i feel like this really helps when i need a little cool down from my personal life. really gives a nice feeling when played. personally, i give this a 10/10. great soundtrack and all. real chill and easy game.
a google user : this is a really nice game... i am really impressed a lot. the controls are easy and smooth and the game never lags... also it becomes more interesting each time i play this. so overall i loved this game. keep it up noodlecake studious inc !!
lajeanna parker : had this download for several years now. great to play for something different other than matching items. very relaxing until you hit a cliff or fall off the mountain. still fun though.
dreamer of words : i played this game every day on the bus ride to school. it was the best part of my morning, even better than breakfast. thank you for making this calming game. i'm sorry the fools that still rate one star doesn't understand that they can play without internet access to avoid the adds. one hope for both adventure and odessy: unlimited wing suit in zen mode. there is no reason not to, right?
classydays43 : one of the most beautiful mobile games i've played. it's stuff like this that makes browsing for decent mobile games worthwhile. given the market, it truly is a diamond in the rough. for those looking for a great game that looks as good as it's playable content, look no further.
chris o'neill : great gameplay, love the visual style. i particularly like that it's not the gameplay that gets harder, but the challenges continue to push your skills
adharsh gajendran : one of the best games i've played so far. the art, music and game design itself have been tested so many times as to cover all use cases. it's so neat and simple, yet so full of features and intricate details. great job!
dinar fitriandini : the graphic is soooo smooth and detailed. i love how simple the concept of the game is but yet they gave us this beautiful graphic. 5 stars from me, good job!
pixiedixiedo : so damn amazing! only thing is usually in the forest biome on my google pixel, it will make really loud static noises, to the point where it gets so loud i have to some times take my earbuds out. i have had this game on other devices though, and it's only ever happened on my pixel
dragon : absolutely gorgeous. the graphics are fantastic, the goals are not too easy but not too hard either, and the unlockable characters are just as gorgeous
erin locke : this game is so relaxing and fun to play! even though it has a simple concept, the fact that it doesn't need wifi improves it a lot! i would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a change of pace in a video game.
javion hughes : this game is so relaxing and it calms me dpwn when im angry wich is ao helpful
vix nechayeva : relaxing and smooth gameplay. sometimes takes a few tries to get the goals but the gameplay itself is enjoyable so slow(ish) progression through levels never bothered me.
spirit - : good game. never gets boring and is just fun to play! the controls are only just one finger so its easy but gets progressively harder as more and more rocks appear. and elders too. coins take a bit long to get but overall the game's great!
jack bourne : the original altos adventure can't get better than that i grew up playing that game at the library for 4 years strait! until they took the ipads away so many good memories and false ones of course. like i said about my odyssey review repetitive but all games like this are so i can't complain about that.jackbourne
1ds20ai033_neeraj kalantri : it is one of the best and the addictive game i ever played. the graphics and the music are so awesome that it truly makes you feel that your are actually riding. the level gets even awazing as well as tuff so that you truly enjoy the game. overall the game is 5 and i highly recommend to everyone to play this game
mohit sharma : one of the best games its soo relaxing
k v vaghul : pleasant game, lovely artwork and music, gameplay is calming. playing since 2016! only thing is sometimes after jumping a chasm any llama nearby falls into it which is quite scary and upsetting haha..!!
saurav : more of a feeling than a game.. gives you chills of being in mountains with all that great music and background mountains . just add more controls and this would be more than perfect.
alex : this is a well made game at first i thought it was those games that doesnt make sense but when i look at the game review's and the photo's of the game i downloaded it and its so fantastic i recommend everybody to download this if you want to hear some calming music while playing.
austin rice : i love this game. it is a perfect game to play before going to sleep, although most times the occasional mandatory advert is loud and jolts you out of your zen state. 10/10, love this game, glad the bugs were worked out. thank you, devs!
bastien bastien : you know, 99% developers make games to gain revenue? well its a fact. i'm so pleased this developer made this game for the players. i haven't found any ads in the game and i also didn't see any in app purchases although i didn't search for them. this game made me feel really good and relaxed. the music is very appeasing in zen mode which is what i play 99% of the time. in zen mode you cannot lose, you just enjoy the amazing music and the amazing graphics! wow! well done developers!
abby powell : one of the most calming games i have ever played, but so entertaining. i absolutely love this game. i am so close to finishing, which i am so excited for! have had it for 4 years now, just to causally play it. it is offline too, so you can play it while traveling! just such a wonderful game.

jason landwer : beautiful game. been playing it for over 8 months now and it's still fun. easy to play but challenging enough to keep me entertained but not so challenging that i get frustrated.

alex toradze : this game is incredible. thank you devs for fixing the crash at startup issue! i hope you guys are able to fix the same crash at startup issue for alto's odyssey!

shivam maurya : i've played thousands games this is the only game i love.. it's peaceful, anti-stress, adventurous and exciting at the same time.. i've completed this whole game twice. it's sequel, alto's odyssey is interesting too.. i've completed that too.. dear developers, thank you. if possible please provide another game of the same genre.
bored ashy : this game is a around amazing i love the art style the music the simple controls i only have one problem with the game and it's that sometimes it rains and last time i checked it's kinda impossible to snowboard in the rain but other than that great game alto's odyssey is great too

e j : beautiful graphics and nice music. fun and easy to play, doesn't shove micro-transactions in your face like other games. not stressful or demanding either :)

yuya kun : very calming i suggest to play eterm youth with it :d
noah botting : it's an amazing game, and for a mobile game, there are barely any ads, it somewhat makes sense, and i sometimes question how tall is the mountain? the only advice for the creaters would be to maybe makes the feathers a bit more common.
wolfna fandom : i love this game!!! my fav part bout it is that it has zen mode and i love listening to music while playing games but dont like ads cause it pauses the music but bc of zen mode u cant die and it perfect for me <3

praise judah : i really like this game and it is very relaxing, however could you make it that the objectives refresh after being achieved whilst still in the session rather than having to fall first?
snnake : what a amazing game. i already play this on iphone in 2015 (out 2014, i can't recall) and i was so impressive, how a simple game can bring you a full and enjoyable experience. are you angry, mad, pissed of? just play the zen mode, enjoy the music, and forget about the real world. 10/10!
aleksandar taragoshev : i played this after playing the sequel for a long time. i feel like the visuals are better in this game, there is more depth and dimension to them. essentially the same game but i feel like it is slower than the sequel.
ritwik joshi : simply awesome. super relaxing. even after playing enough, one wants to always revisit later, a month later or even a year later. timeless. not the 'destroy your life playing 24*7' kind of addictive.
richugang : after you play the zen mode, there is no reason for you to give lower than 5 stars.the sound track so beautiful and it hits you so hard that it almost makes you cry. if you are in a bad mood, just play the zen mode on this game. the whole aesthetics of this game makes you feel so calm and makes you just slow down. this one of my favorite games
jeffrey lageson : in the new update buildings are glitching by having the back flap up or at an angle. and it would only be the grinds. otherwise amazing games. also slight lag.
jared boike : graphics are astoundingly beautiful. props to you devs! the controls are a bit strange, and it takes some getting used to, but that's why this is a skill based game.
afnan mohd : the app is really good when you wear headphones and enjoy the music the graphics are good but when we backflip the animation there could be good and when you lose there also i wish there were some real animations accord to physical world very impressed with this game
christian jay anunciado : game is amazing. beautiful in every aspect. to those people saying this has many ads. well of course, game developers dont work for free and if you don't like their ads just turn off your data or internet connection. y'all are all matured enough to know that.
haridev : this game is just awesome. play it when you are feeling stressed it will freshen up your mind and soul especially it's music. i don't write much reviews but this game is awesome, i also liked the changing weather system and for a 60mb game graphic quality is also good. nothing to say more
xylexphd : this gane is amazing, easy to progress and very fun to play, not to mention its so pretty. ads are more than manageable and also if i recall correctly skippable, 10/10 would rate 6 stars if i could
tanmay khare : first of all "amazing, awesome" i have no words to say i have never played a like this in my whole life .what a beautiful graphics, beautiful snow scene best game please please install it and try thank you so much and one more last thing i want to say that this is my humble request to you please please make more games like these beautiful scenes and graphics thanks again

space walker : best game ever!! love it however it would be more better, if it could have different locations and different background sound effects like altos odyssey!!! its awesome nevertheless good work
francisco gomes : great game. however it seems there's a bug at level 8 when you pick a feather and a magnet in the same run but it doesn't count for the achievement
alexander todorov : i have the game installed for a few years now and never actually rated it. don't even know why, but here it is - it's a great game, fun and easy to play, but not boring, more like relaxing. great graphics as well. it's just a really pleasant experience.
pov sopheak : the best game in playstore. i love this game so much. it's simple but it's fun and great. but i'd like to suggest for new update, alto at night is not good yet. although i turn the full bright on but i still can't see the game well. my alto always dies at night. please fix it thanks you:).
artem kashtanov : 1. when i adjust my phone volume during a ride, the volume tab blocks controls of the game. have to tap once to reactivate the game screen, and only then can gain back control. results in irritating crashes.. 2. during a speed boost the hoover sometimes it's not collected. thus, when i expect to go over a rock afterwards, it doesn't happen. and i crash... quite painful 3. add option to disable hoover 4. wigsuit button is 'hidden' behind my front camera (pixel 3xl). pls, fix auto screen adjust
etphonehomie : i really love the color scheme you chose for this, it makes it look like there's distance. i also love the 120 fps on the razer phone, that makes it even better because the game looks so smooth with these frames.
rahul anand : games are for relaxation. and this is definition of relaxation free of world stress. definitely one of the best games if you are feeling stressed or just want to spend some time alone.
ale mello : very simple to play, one finger, sometimes 2, and you'll have fun. it's challenging, clever and demands attention and persistence.
isaac s : very beautiful game. love the art especialy at sun down. stunts aren't to hard but you can't get down from the ziplines without crashing. but other than that a great game

joanna : the music is so relaxing.. takes out all the stress thanks so much! overall animation is really good!
player 910 : 50/5 it is to easy to learn and aesthetic music in zen mode is . this is the real stress buster game. an tupa harness power 60-90% of all other characters which makes it ulimate character with his own ability (fall into a chasm to discover his power)
madcrazypug7 : this is an absolutely wonderful game, it's the first mobile game in 4 years i have deemed worth spending 2.00 to get the full ad free edition, i've had nothing but fun, 10/10 would reccomend

andrew danis : a perfectly simple game with perfectly simple execution, not often you see a game this good. only note is that with the wingsuit i regularly find myself above the screen typically while doing loop de loops and flips
dhruba ranjan das : it's really a awesome game.... rather it should called a recreational experience... i loved this game. but the graphics should be more attractive... at the end i want to say a great experience i got from this game. thanks to noodlecake studios...
maitrey verma : the game has been on my phone for years. it is a lovely experience. i only have one request and sure would be of many others.. kindly remove the rocks in the game when in zen mode. i would be delighted if this is taken up by you guys. regards
jen tuuli : whenever i'm upset or can't get my brain to stop fixating, i play zen mode on this game. i don't know if it's the asmr type sounds or the peaceful landscapes, but this game helps me so much when i'm struggling. thank you for providing this option. it saves my life some days.
miguel pauwels : this game is blowing my mind ! relaxing and wonderful game! well done!
siddharth ambroise : this is a fantastic game. i have had it for over a year now and i still play it. the zen mode is my favourite because it had some awesome music to accompany the simple gameplay.

crepe penguin : best game i've ever played. the visuals are beautiful, and the music really gets you into an immersive atmosphere. the gameplay is simple. the ads don't bother me that much, but to others it might be a little irritating.

manpreet juneja : aldo's adventure is one pure pack class of how melting a game can be. love the gameplay, graphics are good and the music is beautiful. this is one of the games i'd happily pay for and i'm not a person who usually spends cash on games.
jeffrey harris : a great game which is free though i am confused about why people complain about the ads because of you doing want them just but no ads or else how well the devs get money huh? just stop complaining. and yes the tapping problem is there but that's is just if part of your hand is kinda on the screen you know so stop complaining and get a phone which doesn't have a screen that goes to the edge. sorry for the long review.
mahdieh dehghani : one of the best games that i have ever played. so relaxing! there is just one thing that is bothering, the alto's jump on the logo of the app is backwards. please fix that.
kyle huitt : i'm gonna give this 5 stars because it really is a subtle, beautiful game. zen mode is so relaxing and i love just sitting there watching the world go by. the only thing that bugs me is the grinding sound. for some reason it's a slightly irritating noise and takes me out of my zen.
dinesh kumar : it's super fun and soooooo beautiful, pretty looks super cool. i have no problem with it besides the jumping at times but other than that it's super cool and i'd recommend it
chris fabres : this game has been exceptional throughout my prior experience with it, great graphics and gameplay kept it interesting whenever i had time to spare.
harry lee : simple and fun
vz matthews : such a chill but exciting way to pass the time! took me a bit to understand the hype for this game, but at the end of the day, i can say i really like this game. did i mention the graphics? so minimalist but beautiful visuals, love the aesthetic =)
dezert : this game controls really smoothly and the graphics - it's a visual masterpiece. the scores in this game are incredibly relaxing, especially in zen mode.
utkarsh kalra : noodlecake should make a music app with all such gorgeous sound that are so soothing i mean i had installed this app just to listen to it's background music in zenmode my favourite one is the sound of rain one more suggestion is that enable a nature mode in the game i meant to say that we should be able to choose what kind of music (like morning, night , raining etc ...) we want to listen while gameplay means if no all the sounds coming one after another love u noodlecake for making such great games
thebest_aza : i like the tricks, and the controls are just tapping the screen to jump and hold to flip, and i dont rlly pay attention to graphics so no comment on graphics.
saim sammy : a salute to whoever came up with this idea , basic but breath taking views the experience is overwhelming... i just loved it altough i suck at it . a suggestion, if tye camera could be more zoomed in ...

aurora barnwell : i love the calm of the zen mode, this game is perfect and magical. i recommend it. the art style and music is super serene and i dont get how someone can hate it.

max hunts : i fell in love with this game the moment i saw it! the overal mood and feel it has is just perfect! i adore the music, the style, the characters... <3 definitely worth it!
the knightman : this game has a relaxing feel yet still challenging. sometimes at work when it's hectic it's nice not to play violent games and chill out. after rank/level 10 it takes off.
unknown unknown : found a glitch that when in zen mode and you fall in a gap, you keep falling until void and alto respawns at the begin of the gap which means endless loop of falling. i would like it if you could do it like in the tutorial, when you fall in the gap in the tutorial, and alto skips the gap you can fix it that way.
allan demarest : love this game! it would be great if i could redo the goals from the beginning. or maybe random goals can come up as i keep playing after all the goals have been completed.

azkhuu 8z : rated
moe sb : absolutely amazing game. however, i'd prefer maya to be able to jump over chasms. i know she meant to be slow but having to fail the game with maya just because she can't possibly jump over the chasm is frustrating. other characters don't have this issue.
samantha k. : i think this might be my favorite game. i really enjoy the scenery and the music, it makes me feel at ease. thank you for making this app.
jairo villalobos-hernandez : i love this game. i played this for a long time without stopping. its relaxing yet challenging, which for me its a perfect combination since you do not get too much of either. i would give it 10 stars if it were possible.

karahan sarp karakoc : this is the game that clicks with me. not the sequel, not any other game, but this. this game has something that makes me keep coming after all these years. the relaxing music, minimalist design, and, last but definitely not least, the zen mode. the perfect game it is.
it'll_be_owlright : the most visually stunning and aesthetically pleasing game ever. enchanting music, gorgeous sceneries, exciting & smooth gameplay, and such lovable characters. great job game developers, and thank you!
haley chan : this endless runner is the story of snowboarders pursuing runaway llamas which, as odd as it sounds, actually works for this game! background music is soothing and art is phenomenal.
gp getting to work : amazing game, can you guys figure out how to make it multiplayer, even make it 3d, that would make it the game of the century! also maybe add more characters and free character and board customization and also some snowboarding tricks, maybe endless multiplayer with unlimited players playing together, just some suggestions that you've got to try. amazing game!!!
h. matthew : i think the overall design is great and despite the fact that i have the free version, i don't feel like i'm missing out. this is a prime example of what games in the app store are supposed to be.

shouvik das : awesome gameplay , stunning visuals and peaceful soundtrack.

lokesh harbola : i never felt so happy and peaceful while playing a game . the game runs
super smooth and the graphics are just soooo soothing and change so
smoothly that one wonders if you are really playing the sport or the game.
the concept of the game is simple but yet so intriguing . and the music in
the background just makes you feel so much at peace . no doubt that this is
the best game that can be found in the play store . finally, but i don't
think i can thank you enough for making such a beautiful game .
reno garg : i absolutely love this game, its incredible. the graphics are amazing and i
harldy ever write reviews but for this i had to. its not frustratingly hard
or super easy, and keeps your attention. i love how the scarf changes color
with different power ups and the sceneries are beutiful. thank you so much
for putting the zen mode, very relaxing and i love that you can click
pictures as well. great game
masked parodies subount : i love this game. it helps me relax and the sounds are so soothing when
played with headphones. a suggestion i have is that you should add an ocean
area to this game. so when you pass through this area relaxing wave
crashing sounds can be heard. i also would like crackling logs in a fire
sound effects. these could be maybe presented in a forest fires scene. over
all an amazing game with cute baby llamas. thank you noodlecake studios for
a stunning game with relaxing sounds and visuals, hans
ozymandias : this game has great gameplay, awe inspiring graphics and a beautiful soundtrack. the immersion felt in this game is so breathtaking it's unbelievable. the varying weather makes you feel all cozy and paired with a jaw dropping backdrop i feel truly taken a-back at this games use of natural beauty and style. and all this is enhanced by the games 'zen mode'. i spend hours on this game yet i have never yet got over this games incredible aesthetics.
et tu : gorgeous, calming, endearing, easy to pick up and play. it's clearly been well thought-out. the game itself is engaging and soothing in its own right, but the zen mode is brilliant for moments when you need to occupy your brain and hands with something distracting but not too complicated. this is a work of art. :)
k3v valkyrie : i almost never write reviews unless they are scams but this game is by far
the best mobile game i've ever played. it's so calming as well not to
mention so quick and you can keep going through runs. i've seen many games
like this that i personally hate but this is, as i said the best. the
musical amazing too.
braulio cortez : in my opinion, this game is perfect. no bugs or crashes, yet. art style is
simple, yet when combined with weather effects and daylight changes, it is
a gorgeous sight. the best thing about this game is watching the sunrise,
it's beautiful. and ads aren't even a problem, you can click out of them
instantly, and purchases don't affect gameplay. controls are simple and
when mastered, it is really fun to take risks.
sara : it's quaint, but cute. and the more you progress, the more you get to
discover about the mountain. it gets easier once you get the hang of the
mechanics, and the simplicity is so that you can sit down and relax while
playing this game. however, i'd have to say that my favourite thing about
this game is the backdrops, the art style is adorable, and the lighting and
landscape change with the day patterns. would definitely recommend this to
a friend.
joel k : great game. only thing i dislike is the feature regarding the in-game camera. the photos you take w/ cam doesn't showup in my phones gallery as these images just go into the game file folder, this makes it more time consuming to find and move back to the gallery where they should go for easy access. thanks and keep up the good work!
bim cuachin : great game. i wish there was a move name for when the character lands on
the small piece of land between two chasms. i mean didn't think going
through an arch while using the wingsuit would be worthy of being a move.
the move i mentioned is a lot harder and it is very satisfying to be able
to do it. give it justice. haha. that is all.
samuel tetero : words can not express how beautiful this game is. it's an amazing and
aesthetically pleasing piece of art. the music. the art. the little bits
that just send you through euphoria. it's so perfect and i recommend this
to anyone who needs to relax or feel that perfect tingling sensation. thank
you for making this game, i loved it so much i recommended it to my friends
who are now trying it.
roland telegdi : alto's adventure is an excellent game when you need to pass time. the scenery and the music are right on point and give you a relaxed feel especially if you play in zen mode. the controls are very simple, tap the screen for a jump and hold the screen for a backflip. as you level up you will gain access to several characters with specific advanteges and disadvantages, although i mostly played with alto because he is good in all aspects.
aaron smyth : i never write reviews first and foremost. i absolutely love this game, the
graphics are beautiful and are really reflected by the soundtrack which
sends you into a transient state as you play, both are subtle, simple and
stunning. while an idle "tap tap" game, it fully engrosses and relaxes at
the same time. the only game i have on my device, until odyssey is released
of course. thanks for the hard work, keep it up. perfection.
ashkan ranjbar : fun, challenging, addictive! there's one bug that i'm not sure if i'm the
only one having it and that's when you pause and quit but not kill the
activity (for example if you want to check an important message) and want
to come back playing, the touch doesn't work, so no jumping and no way
unless you kill the app and restart it again
jamie fox : installed the game since the beginning of 2017. still love it. i like how
the graphics are pretty and fancy but together with the relaxing music in
the background makes this game mesmerizing. the gameplay is simple and even
better in the zen mode... the wonderful part of the game. the game features
few characters which you unlock trough the quests. each of them are special
in their own way which makes it interesting. this is one of those
delightful and charming games that you keep on your phone for years because
you know they have never dissapointed you and when you come back to it, the
intro will hit you with nostalgia right away. that's all from me.
malcolm gledhill : love this game. fun, intuitive, and the progession system makes playing
rewarding. only complaint -- the day/night cycle seems too in favour of
night. the game looks gorgeous during the day but i spend most of my time
squinting at the screen trying to make out rocks in the dark.
freddy : alto's adventure is one of the only mobile games i can keep on coming back
to. normally i play a game for a week or two, and then either complete it
or get bored of it. i've had alto's adventure on my phone for years, but i
still enjoy it. i think that demonstrates the quality of the game more than
anything. i'm extremely excited for alto's odyssey to come to android so i
can experience another game like this. edit: having played the most recent
update, i've removed a star. one of the best things about alto's adventure
has always been it's free-to-play nature but still ad-light gameplay. that
seems to have changed, with forced ads now appearing after crashes - while
extra in-app purchases have also been introduced simultaneously. this is
not really fair to long-time nor new players, and i hope alto's odyssey
does not follow this model.
giovanni stanley : i just installed this game again after switching to new device. i've synced my data using google play games account. all of my gameplay record is synced and displayed properly, but all of my progress (unlocked missions, character, bought items and upgrades) is not loaded at all so it seems my progress is resetted. i love this game so much, but please resolve this matter because its just not worth it to play it all over again from the very beginning. or is there any way to load back all of my progress that i missed? thanks
a google user : i love this game. i can't even describe it! i appreciate so much that you
included a zen mode because i get frustrated very easily especially because
of the man that starts chasing you after a while. the graphics are amazing!
so simple but beautiful! same for the music! so relaxing. i love how the
time and climate change. you get to see the sunset and the night. and i
love the rain and thunder in the night. i like how you made the thunder
realistic, 'cause you made sure the sound plays seconds after you see it. i
love the woods. and lastly i love how the point of view "turns" sideways a
bit when you pass the buildings and they look 3d! the alpacas are cute very
nice that you included them! the only thing i could possibly mind is that
the sound of skiing and the rain are the same setting and i really want to
hear the rain but i don't like the skiing sound.
josh woodcock : this is hands down the best game i've had on my phone to date. from the
minimalist visuals to the music, it's a fantastic game. never have i bought
the premium for a game but with the amount of time i've put into alto, it's
the least i could do in return. keep in mind you absolutely do not have to
put any money into this game to have a great time. the leveling system
sometimes has character specific challenges so even if you buy all the
characters and premium, you still cant progress without trying everyone out
at least a few times! the one an only quipp i have is that i wish i could
pick what side the wingsuit button could be on as a lot of the time i'm
playing this game one handed and it's difficult to reach across. i play
this game daily, if you don't have it, get it.
viktor malkoski : after finishing one task - make a 13x combo land, and allmost finishing -
escape 5 elders , after the forth i died and wanted to check if there is a
video for revive , if not to pay 1500 coins. but the app crash and when i
reopened the already finished task wasn't save. this was not the first time
i wasted time on task. i am deleating this game
kin : i waited obyssey for a few months. and it doesn't officially support my
device:(. i downloaded apk version for my huawei mate 10 though and it
works fine. plz let us, hongkonger, use the legal version:( i play alto
adventure zen mode every night. i am now obsessed with obyssey.
evenyng light : great game! keeps you focussed, but doesn't demand too much attention. that
way making mind more and more relaxed. and the gameplay is always
interesting, as small details change when you level up and buy upgrades. as
the changes are small it really makes it easy to feel the game. it's really
balanced and full of harmony. it's been a long while since i've enjoyed a
game this much. from similar games i've played temple run 2. played it a
lot! but this game is in a completely different league! really big thanks
to developers of this app! i like it that much that even ads do not really
disturb me. and that means a lot.
zubayer rahman : altos adventure is a fun and enjoyable game mostly coming from me a game
developer. altos adventure is mostly fun when you have to stay in focus
with the game so you dont get hit by the rocks and lose.
schuyler w : this game is lit af, it's gotta be made of drugs! clearly made with the
player as the central focus. recommended path to success: complete tutorial
eventually croak play zen mode enjoy smiling go back to catching llamas
tell the broskis
noneofyourbusiness : the game is awesome, and filled out all of the "must have" criterias to
make a good game. graphics are simply breathtaking, background music just
makes it better. though the game can get boring after a while , since you
basically are doing the same thing
daedalus da vinci : i have never reviewed a game before, but i don't think any game has ever
deserved it like this one does. the art style is so simplistic yet awe
inspiringly beautiful. the music and the sounds add to the calming and
peaceful effect. this game is absolutely beautiful.
a google user : this game is fantastic! the graphic scenery is stunning, the gameplay is
simple yet fun (and addictive) and the music pieces in both the level and
zen modes are beautiful!! i love this game and i really like all the
characters. i look forward to playing alto's odyssey. and... i wonder if
the makers of the game are also or at least inspired by the game journey.
the style is very much the same, the simplicity and music themes are
incredibly alike and even the idea of the scarves lengthening are the same!
i loved that game so this is a delightful surprise.
adreian vila : this is actually a great game! i love the graphics and the mechanics, and also the zen! the music there is sooo soothing. i wonder if the soundtrack in the normal mode has multiple soundtracks too? like when its raining or snowing or night time? so the soundtack might not too replayable in ear when i found myself failing too often in backflips or cliffs. overall really an awesome game with uniqueness!! :d
we found a camera : this is a beautiful game. it controls very nicely (with the exception of
the occasional gritch) it's an overall charming game. the only problem is
you can use pay to win now. rather than having to play the game.
roulan huang : altos adventure is my favourite game of all time, ever since i stumbled
across it a few years ago i found it as a soothing way to decrease my
stress levels. the graphics is beautiful and it is just an incredible game
that anyone can play
a google user : it relaxes me a lot. i like using it without music to enjoy all the sounds as the weather changes.
sourav debnath : great game with serene graphics. i especially like the time when night
gradually changes to daybreak...its a gem of a game which gives immense joy
to the player...
shaun buss : i love this game. it is probably my all time favorite mobile game. i do
wish there was more to do after completing all achievements, but i still
love it.
aditya gauranga : pretty simple game with soothing and calming music. the graphics are
actually well made even though it the trees look like minecraft . loved
the game
tenu bhagat : it is a heart touching game and the song of this game is very smooth and
like a natural. it gives us help in our loneliness
will thorogood : i'm having some problems with the game, recently reinstalled it and now i
get serious graphical errors whenever it rains or snows, with discoloured
shards shooting across the screen. other than that this game is fantastic
:)))
brad : alto's adventure is a great minimalistic adventure game that i can play for
hours. great time waster.
*insert egg pun here* : great game, my favourite bit is zen mode, love the picture taking feature
and my only suggestion is that you add costumes for the players so people
can customize them.
tomasz kosiak : game is fantastic many hours to play. nice workshop with several added features which u can get by making new levels
abhijit chandra : it's a pleasure to pick up & play this masterpiece. looking forward to
odyssey. still no sign though. i've been pre-registered for a long time.
seems like a year has passed by since that.
ksa alpine : i loved every little bit it has been and always will be my favorite mobile
game im excited for alto's odyssey
mircha rubio : this app has amazing graphics and a surreal feel to it. it has a calm
asthetic to it and a chill vibe. if you want to relax the most play with
headphones in
sarath chandra yanamandra : this game is absolutely amazing.. though the gameplay, controls and and
other aspects are just average... what won me over was the music... if i
could i would give it 6 stars for its music..... not that this is the best
music, but i haven't seen any other game with music soooooo apt with
gameplay.. it just melts you into the game..
ella eske : i love this game, just found the zen mode, i wish i could build up my coins
in zen but other than that it's fantastic.
a google user : incredible game. i recently had problems because it wouldn't respond to my
touch. otherwise i cannot find a game better than alto
a google user : this game is wonderful for the anxious or the overthinkers. i can
completely zone out and think of nothing while playing and it's delightful.
love this game.
fawnica : absolutely stunning. it's challenging yet fun. and zen mode a great feature
that is both beautiful and calming. definitely would recommend this app.
izumi konomi : this game is very good. it had beautiful graphic for a mobile game, simple
controls, fun, and free and also not pay 2 win. the addition of zen mode
perfects it since u can enjoy the scenery without a game over scene. well
done noodlecake studios you made what i call one of the best mobile game of
all time.
canned pears : i really like the game because you can play it anywhere, beautiful graphics, and amazing music. i could play this game all day
md. tawhidul islam : this is one of my most favourite games. great animation, greater music and the greatest zen mode. it takes me to a dream world. thanks a lot.
anthony tran : i like the game, but it's a bit laggy and when i get the blue levitation feather, it does not work on some 9f my runs since the last android software update. please fix this.
isaac barkers : everything about the game is just great. but, when using tupa, the game
exits on its own so i can't complete his quests
adam sergeant : with out a doubt my favorite gamging app. just pick up and play. long or
short. it's just great
woosi wildwood : i love this game! the only complaint i have is that the llamas make sheep noises, not llama noises. as a previous llama owner, this bugs me every time. i have fun with the challenges and fun in zen mode. one of my favorite relaxation and distraction games.
priyanshu singh : very addictive, soothing and relaxing. the scenery and music is osum . i am
playing this game since last 2 years but i never get bored. but the only
problem is the cost of characters are very high .
bibby john : when i try to watch an af to revive the app restarts. occasionally the
trick boost just doesnt happen if you jump right after.
shanoy banerjee : this is pure art. it really draws you inside these beautiful mountains and
valleys. the transition of the day and seasons is simply mind blowing.
great work team. one of the best games on android.
sok vannsak : very nice endless runner game! i'm impressed with the art style and
soundtrack. it's so relaxing. it's one the best runner game ever.
eventhough some reviews said its gameplay isn't original though but it is
the game that should be recommended afterward.
arbas ali : what a beautiful game. the music calms your soul. the free mode is
genuinely the best and truest free mode i have ever experienced. in love.
prerna sharma : well i just love this game.. graphics are soo nice.. also it has tasks and different characters to unlock.. keep you engaged must download
ankit shahu : the best music for a game if compared with any of rivals. one in a trillion
type of game. this is all for the game's music, uniquely divine. long live
alto
rodie cox : a lot of fun. simple, basic game play. great for commercial breaks or
anytime you have 1 or 2 minutes to do a quick run
a google user : when i was rating this game the maximum amount of stars was 5. that is
weird, because with this games amazing graphics, intriguing game play, and
llamas it deserves 6/5 stars. i recommend it to anyone who wants to relax
and go on an adventure.
kaela ward : not only is this game beautifully made and very relaxing, it taught me
something in zen mode.it taught me to not be afraid to jump, cause in zen
mode there is no dying, no score, just you and the snowy mountains of the
appalachians.
skiddlywoo : i absoulutely love this game. the animation and sounds just go together
perfectly. it's fun and beautiful and its definitely one of my favourite
apps
thc the high channel : well the game is amazing but i have tryed and tryed to get alto odyssey and
it just won't work fix it i really wanna play
ali oyman : i play this everyday everynight! never got bored of playing it fun and competitive game nice smooth graphics and nice control. lots of achievement to do!
redcake : great game i absolutely loved it and cannot wait for altos oddysey in 1
months time, only issue i have is that you can only do back flips, but
amazing game i'm know addicted
tyler champion : this game is so relaxing and wonderful to play! the graphics are so
calming. i love listening to the sounds of rain and the music. the visuals
are awesome, it plays well, i really don't have any complaints with it!
avery bay : super easy, calm game. the only disappointment is that you have to buy the rest of the characters but above all its great!!
abhishek verma : great game ... while playing you will get lost into its mountains & soothing music that makes your mind relax .
pippin sadler : very beautifully made. this game has lots of mini missions to increase
levels or you can just go snowboarding for the fun of it.
a google user : great game. if you notice the moon actual turns in the background when it
night. does not happens in real life so great yea not much else to say
tom mercer : played this game for a while, and it is still one of the best mobile games
i have played. i am excited to see what additions alto's odyssey brings in
the near future.
i morrow : this game is epic its kind of hard at the start though but when you know
when you need to do the tricks it feels like ur the master.
yash wanth : it's really so awoesm game i loved a lot. and the gameplay so nyc, and
sound effect i loved very much
shay mj : ok so its like one of those games that don't suck. i'm looking at you
"pixelcraft" see i like this game because it has a purpose in life not like
"pixelcraft" those games get poor people like a 4 year old looking for game
because they don't have anything to do like my 2 kids. they really don't
care.
angel morales : i really recommend this game to all of you people who want to get the stress off of your life's. it is a good alternative to distract your mind but above all learn something new in this epic and entertained game. i loved it so what are you waiting for? download it and find out by yourself
jonny stamper : simply brilliant, a game of pure simplicity with a relaxing presence to the
game. constantly trying to achieve a higher score and climb though levels.
the no frills graphics are a pleasure to work with, a relaxing game but
still staying alert to avoid rocks, canyons etc. highly recommended for a
download
jason alv : this game is overall a beautiful game, it has amazing music, art style,
easy controls and it feels really good playing the game. definitely
recommended
manthankumar satani : the game is great. it has amazing, soft and relaxing music and graphic design are also good. i love it and enjoying it so much. thanks to the developer and thanks to who gave the idea of this wonderful adventure game
mia bourke delaney : i love the graphics and i'm really really love the background and the
scenery but it would be a bit better if you could go a little bit faster
and the jumps would be easier to do that's all i got to say other than that
i love this game
guddi rana : the best game i have ever played.i wish i could have installed it earlier.
pleasant sound and ever calm and beautiful background. i loved this
game.
farimah rostamzad : i really love this game but i hate every kind of rock that make u lose! i try to fly over it but some where it doesn't work and makes me angry!
totheflyingdevice : great game, but i've finished it. it loses it's charm when there is nothing
left to do. update with new challenges please.
m k : beautiful graphics and amazing gameplay. you can play forever and not get
bored. i wouldn't mind paying for no ads.
john newman : two things, make provisions to attack the elder guy, sometimes the player
posture is not clear while back flip with the trees and stuff crossing. add
some slow motion graphics with pause in music while crossing cliffs. add
front flip
raliquint : this is the best game i had played ot changed my life i would rate this
game 10 out of 10
bruno chegancas : love the game. don't know why but randomly it shows advertisement ls its of
sexual related content. lame
erik s. : this game is a great stress reliever. go in to zen mode and just relax, the
music, the visuals, the gameplay is all great. simple controls tap to jump
that's it. you should get this game. five star
phillip kurtis : the simplicity is a big part of what makes this game fun. the ads are not
unreasonable for a free game, and there aren't a lot of grabs for your
money. a relaxing, well rounded game. earns the devs some respect in my
book :)
reece lujan : amazing simplistic graphics with beautiful environments, multiple
characters with new abilities to unlock, and an endless zen mode to relax
to while the soothing music plays makes this a great mobile game to easily
pick up and play.
kashi shadow : amazing, and still amazing but a small feature like actually making the
games open each other instead of sending to google play when installed
would be nice. honestly i would play both and to make it more awesome,
actually make the oddesy to adventure not just a promo link
avijit sarkar : i'm not much of game loving person but i like alto. its scenic beauty as
well as music is so soothing.
ronit bhattacharjee : this game is perfect for stress relief ...... just tap into zen mode on a

and the intro. also i like how the old man chases you it's a nice touch, lol
a google user : this is so cool! the graphics are awesome, and the music is pretty cool
too! this is one of the best apps i've ever played.
jyotirmoy chakraborty : this is one of the best games ever made. however, it would be great if it
could be optimised for displays such as the samsung galaxy s9+ and other
such displays with aspect ratios of 18:9 and above as it does not cover the
entire screen.
high kings : alto's adventure is no doubt is a perfect offline game, this game is one which make me 5 star any offline game. graphics, sounds and characters are stunning. what's make this game different and great is it's special zen mode, it's really very relaxing. i gave my review after playing 31 levels and it's truly a good game on play store. keep it up noodlecake studios

to games. my only complaint is being stuck on the same objective for
months...wish there was a way to just skip it.
kim francis : this game is so much fun and you don't have to spend money to enjoy it. it's calming and really enjoyable and the challenges change per run. not your run-of-the-mill run game.

game makes me so happy again!! love it! so calm! and love the graphis!

and artstyle, and the intuitive controls make this game a must have! keep
up the great work devs
zack shillingford : very good. i would really recommend this to friends. nice to chill out and
play as well. lovely music in the background. easy to use as well.
x49v : great game if you want to kill some time, maybe add something that launches the other game instead of bringing you to the play store.
claire foley : gorgeous game, the soundtrack and graphics are beautiful and the gameplay
is the perfect balance between fun and challenging. zen mode was also a
really great addition for when you just want to relax and enjoy the
scenery, and its own music is lovely! and the characters are all so cute! i
love alto, i've had it for over two years now and i still enjoy it very
much!

better than meditation. it's really the best game in the world.

irkulla abhilash : another world
subbarao rao : super graphics
elijah chua : the game is absolutely amazing. i was playing the game then thought of what
i think is just a really cool minor detail to add in. when alto falls in
zen mode and he's on the ground and his board is away from him. since
there's no rush in zen mode, could you make it so that alto stands up,
walks to his board and continues. that would be pretty neat.
bean jam : this game deserves awards. incredible art and visuals, top-notch sound,
solid controls, the character's physics seem real and act like they should;
not too difficult to make anybody ragequit, but just right to make you fail
enough to make it a fun type of difficult and ever so rewarding to get to a
new level. get this game, not asking, telling. 10/10
stei : breathtakingly stunning. the level design is minimalistic with beautiful day to night cycles while you're skating down the mountain. complete with crisp sound design like the sound of drizzling rain and thunder, accompanied by a vibrant musical score in the background that compliments the game as you play, it's a satisfyingly zen experience. hell, it even has a zen mode. if you're having a rough day, the zen mode is probably the most satisfying and calming experience you can find in mobile video game.
greg cruickshank : the art style is amazing. the zen mode and overall atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining. my big issue is after resetting my progress once i completed everything. you loose the coin doubling upgrade that you pay real money for. why must i re purchase some i have already bought. why does resetting my progress reset something i purchased with real money. i feel that is a little unfair and even from a premium purchaser is pretty jading, i really enjoy the game and will change to a 5 star once an answer is provided or it is fixed.
ben sim : i remember back when this game would cost money on ios. i would literally try to download every single third party helper app just to look for this game. now that i actually have a phone, its free. i think this game is great for both relaxing and competitive play. and i am so hyped for the odyssey. i check often to see if it is there. 10/10 would recommend this game.
arqam malik : its a simple game with very simple things but still is exciting to play. if you are looking for a little mental relaxation or peace and still be able to enjoy the adventure, then this is a perfect thing. there are things i would love to improve. for instance the landing - and background music should have a variety. also the zen mode is a cool little bonus but the music volume should be greater than other sounds. hope to see these improvements..
luca schulz : i genuinely love this game. it has one of the most stunning and beautiful
graphic styles i've seen in mobile games in a while. i love the games
simplistic but incredibly well executed gameplay. can't stress enough how
good looking this game is, a great and satisfyingly addictive experience
honestly have no complaints.
matthew denholm : absolutely stunning. the graphics and visuals, weather and day/night cycles
are so smooth and so dynamic! just incredible. how i would describe this
masterpiece is this: it's a lot like ski safari, only not a clone, because
it's miles too good to be a clone. i could keep praising this game for a
long time more, but i've written enough already.
zuza kurzawa : normally i dont write reviews to games. but this one is outstanding. it's beautiful (graphics and music also deserves attention) and so much fun to play! easy to play but hard to master, provides a challenge for long, if you seek it. it has ads and in app purchases but they are irrelevant for the game and very discreet. it's really outstanding that such a game can be free without aggressive adds destroying your fun time. app has no bugs or issues. thank you, creators of this game!
trevor ryan : love the theme and art style. very satisfying, simple mechanics, but reasonably difficult. wish there were more games that utilized this theme and art style. maybe as an interactive story game. update: still love this game but it's always crashing now after about 5-10 minutes playing. don't want to loose all my stats by re-installing. seems i'm not the only one with this issue. hope it can be looked into soon!
josh gatto : this game is amazing from head to toe. i've only been playing for a few
hours and i love everything from the simple, minimalistic design to the
intuative controls and even music design. everything about this game has so
much time and care put into it. the game is completely fair and has no
tricks up it's sleeve knock you down right before you hit that high score.
also love the fact that there are no micro transactions and of there are
they're not in you're face at all. of course with a free game there are ads
every now and then but nothing annoying like 30 second ads or that pop up
in the middle of a run. all in all, the game is fantastic and could not
recommend it enough.
vedant kale : i usually never write reviews for games but by god, i am writing this just to make sure the creators feel appreciated. you have done a great job at making this game. the zen mode with the calm, emotional but uplifting background music is very heartwarming and makes you feel great about the moment.
xeo224 : amazing game! the only thing i could think of to improve it would be a slight increase in tempo in the music when being chased by an elder or something of that nature. that's just me being nitpicky though, keep it up! great mechanics, really cute and minimalist. would definitely recommend to a friend! :)
adam bromiley : i've had alto's adventure for a couple of years now. it is one of the most highly-polished games i've ever seen. the minimalist art style is stunning and fits with the quick tap and play gamestyle. the progression is challenging and takes time so it's not a game that will be quick to finish and put down. my only downside is that there is not a setting to move the wingsuit button to the other side of the screen but there is for the pause button. this aside it's a great game and well-worth the five stars. thanks to the devs and i'm wishing you luck for the upcoming alto's odyssey! :)
jax p : amazing game! the graphics of this game are stunning and i love the gameplay! it isn't that hard which i like. it's easy to complete challenges and do tricks (which i love!) this game is similar to temple run, but not as difficult. i am completely in love with the zen mode, you just snowboard down a mountain. it's such a calm game and very addictive as well, especially in the zen mode. i highly recommend this game!
temporicidal : this game seems stunning, but for whatever reason it won't let me jump. the
screen works fine otherwise, but it doesn't allow me to jump over rocks and
such. i'd rate it a five if not for that. i'm going to try uninstalling
then reinstalling it now. edit: it's now working perfectly and is arguably
one of the best mobile games i've ever played! very soothing and helps with
my anxiety
alfredo lim : it's a great game that emphasizes the simple nature of an adventure. it's a simple game, yet the bizzare mystic ambiance fuels the imagination to discover what lies ahead of their expedition. i like it because there are always things to discover and it fixiates itself around the meaning of achievement.
ohad marbach : great game. finished it ( )was not easy especialy level 45 but done!) lived
everything. one problen i had was touch that sonetimes didnt respond but i
worked around - when unplugging the usb the problem wad gone so i just
played when not charging. this is why i changed my score back to 5 stars.
good job.
a google user : i am in love with this game. after downloading it for a couple of weeks i
played n then discovered d zen mode!! oh man!! it is so peaceful i don't
why but it left me in such a positive serene state and the fact dt it
doesn't stop and even after falling it continues .. it's amazing ! thankyou
so much for creating such a wonderful game!
hakan bilenler : one of the few mobile games i "finished". graphics, music gameplay is perfect. very simple to learn and fun for many hours. just enough progression and achievements to keep you hooked and keep you returning. no annoying f2p mechanics either. i bought the premium version. best couple of bucks spend on mobile.
eve aguera : so idk what happened with a recent update, im a premium player so maybe it was in that update but my game will randomly force close now, thought it might have just been my phone but recently got a new phone and it is persistent. can you guys please look into a fix, i love this game and the force crashing seems to be happening more frequently
shreya : this game is very relaxing, the graphics and soothing sounds in the background makes me feel like i am skating there in real.
stephanie djidjev : love this game! it's a great way to pass time and it doesn't get boring. the only issue is, i've completed all the objectives and can't reset my progress. i'll reset it to the beginning, and then when i open the app again after. while, it'll take me back to the state before i reset. wish it had more re-playability :/
bob bob : *for computer nerds 30ish to 50ish*: it's skifree, only much prettier, with
actual (gorgeous) sound and music, and you can finally escape from what's
chasing you. *for everyone else*: play this game. it's that simple, because
the gameplay is as simple or involved as you want it to be. if you want to
care about points, fine. if you want a high score distance each run, go for
it. if you just want to cruise and let the goals be completed where they
will, be my guest. the gameplay is clean and very inviting, the look and
feel is beautiful, and the music is well suited to the environment you're
in. put simply, this is one of the best mobile games i've ever tried.
protodot : the gameplay is alright, about standard for what you normally get it off infinite runners. but that's not the reason that you'll play this. the visuals are amazing and run on toasters. i was floored when i saw my first sunset, the rain looks great, and the glow that the sun, coins, and powerups looks great.
giorgos kakitsis : i came back to alto after a while, just cause i missed the artwork of the game, and i was so enthusiastic to find out there was a zen mode. it does everything right. just music and ambience and minor goals set by yourself only if you want to. thank you so much for this.
iqbal kour : the most intuitive game. real enjoyment . it's not about levels .go in the zen mode and have fun . 5 stars for the awesome people behind this masterpiece.
wonderoussmiles : okay. first off, i'm actually bothering to write a review cause this is one
of the very few games that don't pester me about it. it's fun. its artstyle
gives me journey vibes. there's a zen mode, which will be great for long
flights...assuming it really does work offline (haven't tested that yet)
and best of all its nothing like most mobile games. they dont bother you.
there's no timers and no just having to watch the screen. no push
notifications. there's no endless harassment to buy the premium currcency -
actually there's no preminum currcency! i've played endless runner games
where you have limited lives. and when that runs put you'd have to wait or
pay. not fun there's no random obstructive pop up ads. in fact the only ads
i recall seeing is the video ad. and even then you can simply choose not to
watch it and restart the stage. simple simple. ever since my ds broke i had
to rely on cell phone games for my mobile gaming fix. and its been so long
since i've been treated with basic respect from mobile game developers.
thank you. so just as i think bad behavior should be punished, i think good
behavior should be rewarded. and thats why i bought the premium upgrade. no
regrets. i will be recommending this.

hirokatsu victor : this is great and relaxing game with an option to freely play in a zen
state. i would gladly suggest for a frontflip to counter the backflips and

still a calming and soothing game for those who are stressed or wants peace.

you can play as an alpaca.
jfacee 14083 : this is a really good game! i'm addicted! it's a simple game, that makes the game more exciting! can't wait for the next game!!!
d n pandit : an big suggestions: 1} keep a option of selecting music and also provide
more music.. 2} keep some super coins at the end of the rope or keep coins
on rope because we get nothing on rope expect points.. 3} give detailed
description of the speciality of the characters. for eg : maya rotates fast
in air and paz travels fast. 4} the most important give some coins as
rewards when you complete a level bcoz it becomes boring when you spend
time for completing a mission and by seeing the reward it makes it more
addictive......i hope you would do the following changes.. if you won't
,then i'm refusing to give five star bcoz that makes this satisfying game a
worse simple like other games . never seen such a beautiful game

dom : simply yet majestically beautiful and stunning. a very inspiring game. the category in which this game has mastered is the graphics. especially in zen mode, this gives a peaceful atmosphere. the graphics and pictures are amazing. the simple geometry made nature in the backround, and the light and color is perfect. along with the music, this makes the game pleasurable to play. secondary, the controls are easy, and ambidextrous. i love that you can also take pictures easily of the screen and game. the content is great. the game is challenging. the only con is that the game has ads. i know it is hard to keep up with money for a game programmer. but, with this app, it completely ruins the relaxing atmosphere of the game. overall, this is a outstanding game, and i would reccomend it. keep up the good work noodlecake! i am very excited for alto's odessey!

quails on rails piety : easter egg found ... after you end a run hit the plus button next to the coin collector..( a video will play ) once the video has played you get 500 coins added. stay in that screen and press your home button then return back to your game. you will get 500 more each time you leave and come back to your game. collect coins unlock everything beat game fast...
james crawford : don't usually leave a review but had this game a long time and it's by far the best game i've played on a phone. it's the one i never uninstall and always find time to play. this is seriously one of the most relaxing and beautifully designed games out there. perfect for when you're feeling stressed out and you need to take your mind away from things for a while. there's a dedicated zen mode as well for when you want to really chill out while playing. looking forward to the sequel.
roza zilonitis : 5 stars no questions about it. yesterday for some reason tried this game while headphones were in and omg such a nice twist with sounds guys. nice work on that. music is beautiful same as graphics, nice and moody. one thing though that happened since last update is crashes once in a while on nexus 7. game just quits by itself.
ilaria passano : 1. add more stuff 2. it lags or crashes often. 3. once i watched a video to get an extra life but then the game didn't work. 4. another time, after paying 1500 coins to go on playing, i almost completed the mission but a late notification that a video wasn't avaiable appeared on the screen and i lost.
s0pk : alto's adventure is a chill snowboarding game by noodlecake where you as a alto snowboard an endless mountain for a reason you can decide. either for score, challenges, for fun in zen mode or for lamas. this game is currently my favourite and i believe many others too. altos adventure also includes really relaxing music while playing varying from mode. in normal mode you'll play mostly for score and challenges. in zen mode there is no objectives nor game overs, you fail, you get up and continue where you left. no others to say than 5/5 would play anytime
xi : one of the best free mobile game i've ever downloaded, i recently changed my phone and i completely forgot about this game but i'm so glad one day i was just scrolling through the store out of boredom and nothing to play that i found this again. i can't express how happy i am to have found it again. absolutely beautiful, it's calming and i have happily played for hours, i love this game and don't get me started on the artwork and graphics
kurtis daniels : usually i'm not a huge fan of runners. the same set of obstacles and
actions make them get old fast. that can't be said for this game, however.
it has enough variation that it captures my attention every time i pick it
up. i'm also a huge fan of the graphics and like how there are events such
as night and rain. all in all, a stunning creation. this will be in my
games folder for a long time.
alby : it's a nice calming down game that doesn't put pressure on you to get everything done. it's a choice to complete everything and you can restart if you want. my only problem is sometimes when i tap on the screen it doesn't work but that might be because it's cracked so i don't blame this game. but it also has been kicking me out mid play.
robotic wizard88 : this game reminds me of life...ups and downs and whatnot. but there are a few things i have learned. if there is a rock in the way, use it to make you soar higher than ever. look at those low points coming up and remember that there is a steep incline ahead that you can either choose to ride, or come out doing a freaking backflip.
cp gautam : clearly a game like non other. even the visuals alone make you want to play it all day long. though there are some bugs such as after picking a feather the only change is your character turns blue, also sometimes you simply pass through magnets and coins without collecting them.
chaitanya tahasildar : i have played number of games & uninstalled once completed or after getting tired. but this game is special. the background music, graphics, controls all are smooth & perfect. it just takes you to that place. although there are almost no hard challenges in game, it deserves to be stay up on someone's favourite game list.
mark onnen : this is the story of a humble alpine llama herder who is also the greatest snowboarder in the world. simply put, alto's adventure is the best endless runner ever made. it is simple yet affords a great deal of variety in gameplay, and the visuals are clean, beautiful, and avoid the garish oversaturation of color that is so common in mobile games. i hope more developers choose choose to follow alto's free-to-play model in the future.
stephen isaac : i have been enjoying it till recently, the game has started hanging whenever it meets powerups. sometimes even after switching off the phone it continues to hang, sometimes it runs okay. hope this problem can be solved, quite irritating especially when aiming for a goal.
leo eppinga : all-around my favorite mobile game ever. if you're looking for an excellent offline timewaster, this is the game for you. it's a long game with devilishly tricky goals, but nothing impossible. i recently unlocked the last character, and i've enjoyed every one of the many hours i've spent playing this game. there isn't much story, but it's perfect in every other way. it's also really battery-efficient, as it's a 2d (runner?) game with a good zoom distance, so the graphics don't need to be perfect to give them a crisp, clean, polished look. you can also customize options to what best suits you. 11/10 would play again.
kaidyn sisk : i love this game, unfortunately there's a bug happening where i no longer float when i get the feather power up, so i am unable to get the "catch 3 llamas while floating" achievement. other than that issue, this game is beautiful and extremely addictive. i'll definitely play it again if that issue ever gets fixed.
taylortyler999 : i love this game. i've installed and deleted alot of games that i've gotten tired of, but this one is the only o.g. ! i would only suggest, not professionally of course, but from the gameplay, that you should be able to get more upgrades, like your speed, jump, and maybe even be able to change the clothes that alto wears. even if this game stays the same, i will still love it, so no worries.
etz oren : one of my favorite games ever. one of my favorite things about this amazing game is that it's simple. there are so many games that are so confusing and with so much stuff, but this game is simple. my favorite things in the game are: 1. the music 2. the graphics 3. the gamplay one of my beloved things about the game is that it offers so much more like merchandise, photo mode (where you can take a photo when you want to; you pause the game and take a photo anytime you want), portraits and so much more! this is such an amazing game and i think that's it's underappreciated. good luck in your following game: alto's odessy! (i wish you'll make the alto's odessy the same chip in the corner of the a and the o)
noah infinity : alto's adventure has to be on of the best, if not, the best recent mobile game that the app store/ google play store has had. the recent zen mode is my choice of play because i can take some great photos with it. i don't know why i dropped this game in 2015. i cannot tell you how excited i am for alto's odyssey. snowman and noodlecake, you have done good.
a google user : the is a great game, there's a lot of detail in the design, the sounds, and is just a lot of fun to play. the only thing i don't like to much is the progress systems. after obtaining maya the other characters don't add much. the stretch goals become a little bit of a grind (pun intended). still i return to play this game occasionally, but i don't think i'll ever reach the final level, i'd rather just string a ridiculous combo than meet some boring goal.
jessica kane : a beautiful game! i love to play it to get my mind off troubling things. the only negative is that sometimes i don't get revived after watching an ad or spending coins and the same thing happens with getting coins as well. other than that, the game is amazing. beautiful graphics, balanced characters and a good time killer.
jacob hurlock : one of the best games i ever played. the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is fun, and overall just amazing. just one thing - there were two glitches i found: if you crashed, you could go to multitask and back in and it revives you. also, if you watch a video for 500 coins, it gives you 1000 coins, and every time you exit and go back in to the app, it gives you 1000 more. (not saying they're bad, just sayin)
logan henderson : this is a beautiful game and the 'zen mode' is very relaxing and a great stress relief method. the controls are basic and easy to learn and it doesn't push ad's onto the player, instead it allows the player to watch an ad to maintain a higher score and longer distance in the normal game mode. this is by far my favourite game on android!
erika m. cecena : dear noodlecake studios, i recently discovered a game breaking glitch that gives you a bunch of coins. here's how i found it. watch an ad for 500 coins. then exit and reopen the app. it'll give you 500 coins more. then do the same thing over and over again. i don't know if it's a bug or anything but, plz fix it!
mge : stunning, emotional, relaxing, and amazing. the game runs flawlessly, simplistic graphics but done very very well. as some, the zen mode is my favorite because its so relaxing. the music in this game is one of the main features in the game. it's so relaxing and calming it's incredible. my only criticism if i had to have one is able to do more than a backflip but even that's being picky. the changing time in day is flawless and i can't say enough good things about my experience with this game. thank you for making a game/app that is like this one
ayaan hussain : great game. artwork and sons effects are awesome. one problem is that sometimes when i grab a magnet or hover feather the game crashes. please fix this. in the next update maybe you could add more snowboards that are faster and can flip faster and each have a special ability. keep up the good work.
zero 223 : pls add were u can custimize ur charcter by buying. scarfs hoods jeans also what would be cool to race your friends gohst by adding them to have. leader bourd wars and see whos best if u added this stuff id rate 5 stars and make all my friends get this game u have a good idea but u could make it evan better with this stuff
muhammad faizan : beautiful, mesmerising, captivating and perfect. my only suggestion is to add a bit of story as well alongside the usual challenges. off course they could be added for the next alto game but other than the zen mode is what kept me playing this for hours.
tim kraske : absolutely love this game! it's very relaxing, and can wind down a hyperactive autistic adult like myself. i love the music so much, it sometimes lulls me to sleep. it's worth the time, and effort to get tupa, as he's a combination of all the other characters, and is very fun to play as. i'm looking forward to alto's odyssey when it comes. nice work on the game!
michelle m. : the game is really good, but i've noticed that alto's scarf and the ends of the wingsuit don't cast shadows. i'm not sure if that's a glitch i'm experiencing or just something that was overlooked. other than that, i really love this game and everything about it is so clean and beautiful
dudley barker : by far the best, most enjoyable, beautifully illustrated and relaxing games i have played in years - have reset it so many times now i've lost track. could do with something a bit faster and a little more dangerous, but it's perfect just as it is...
az levven : i am the type of person that hates simple games, including runner-up types of games (especially because they're repetitive and all the same). however, this one is a special case. the aesthetic attracted me so i decided to give it a go. damn, i thought, this game is great! it's simple, yet still entretaining plus the scenery is very relaxing and really helps you get into the game and mentally rest for a bit, despite the fact it's challenging. it's the only game if its genre i haven't uninstalled after 5 minutes. love it!
noble puzzler : this game is really fun and challenging, great to pick up any time! the artwork is just beautiful, and zen mode is actually pretty relaxing because you don't have to worry if you fall as you can get up right away. the only thing i would change is different songs, the music is beautiful but a little repetitive. i have installed and uninstalled many other games, but this one has stood the test of time. five stars!
zane truesdale : i adore this game. it's so simple and fun. the visuals are absolutely stunning and the music is beautiful. it's just so calm and relaxing to play. the challenges of levelling up make the game more fun and make me want to unlock all the characters. i gave this 5 stars but some possible improvements include: *add a speedometer to show how fast the rider is moving *add some other game modes maybe but whatever you do please keep the aesthetics and controls simple!
a google user : it is amazing and interactive game for all age. the simple and smooth graphics make it to liked by all the players. the gamecontrol is little slow but the sound track is awesome with changes with the surroundings. no doubt that is the best editor choice game which i have ever played. huge round of applause for " alto's adventure ".
a google user : this game is unbelievably stunning. everything about it just sets you at ease, the graphics, the music, the gameplay. this is by far the best game i have ever played, and i've played a lot of them. what you do in this game is you go down a hill and try to catch llamas. you jump over rocks, do flips, ride on flag lines (i think that's what they're called)and catch your llamas. there is also a zen mode which is my favorite. the music is absolutely beautiful and relaxing, and the graphics are simple, but on the best way. i can't describe in words how beautiful this game is. if i could, i would give it 10/5 stars!
anindya guha : this is a great simple game -- the artwork and music are both great and i find it greatly relaxing to play this. i also like the fact that there are some small goals you need to achieve to go up to the next level -- kind of gives you a purpose to keep playing.
constantin schneider : this has got to be one of the best games i've ever played. it's incredibly relaxing but exciting and challenging at the same time. there is absolutely no flaws whatsoever, except for a few bugs here and there. barely happens tho.
a google user : absolutely beautiful and fun. zen mode is a great way to relax and calm your mind. especially with headphones. the music and sound effects are very well done and the graphics are beautiful.
raphael levine : i love this game so much! well worth the download. the artstyle, the game itself, the different characters each with their own personalities, and the music! the music in this is amazing, and unfortunately leads to my one issue with the game: you can't purchase the music in any way. please noodlecake, allow this soundtrack to be purchased and i'm sure you won't regret it.
just ignore me : it's relaxed to play on zen mode, i really love this game. the scene and music make me sleepy and help my insomnia. but it'll better if the moon shapes changing, or some scene of eclipse, or supermoon.. i hope this game will be better as time goes by
parteek dhawan : amazing game. love it. relaxing, peaceful, joyful, timepass, simple, musical and addictive. a game that relax you. but it's lil difficult to play when there is night in the game and i'm sitting under the sun light. so it's too dark screen even at full brightness that i'm unable to see properly inside the game. beside this everything is just awesome.
christian setiawan : when art meet entertainment .. this is lovely game.. very artistic.. what i like the most is the best hd audio experience.. this game give you real meaning of stress killer, cause game should give us calm feeling instead put our life more frustrated.. really looking forward for more of this kind..
marble.magpie : i love this! the graphics are beautiful and i love the music. zen mode is so cool, the music is just so calming and peaceful. i love all the characters, especially felipe! it's kinda cool how you can see the different stats, like how far you have gone, or how many elders you woke up. and the wingsuit is super cool!! over all, it's addictive, fun, and has beautiful music and graphics. keep up the good work!
hayden polanco : reminds me of the playstation game journey. it's a visual piece to me, not just a game but a for of art, simply put you must experience it. best decription of it is relaxing and peaceful.
ian lawrence : i love this game but recently it's been randomly crashing. not sure what makes it happen but i'm on the higher levels so the challenges are harder and it's frustrating to have to get try for them more than once because i lose my run
tony ip : beautiful stunning graphics... intense gameplay with smooth controls. love how the background changes from day to night and other weather conditions like lightning. would def recommend x
sinister cin : just you, your lamas, and a endless mountain. just loving the graphics so much, and the controls are simple but tricky. one of the best games i played
william universe : this game is phenomenal, majestic even. even though the concept is simple, the developers turned that simple game into something beautiful. the gameplay is gorgeous, the graphics are stellar. the best part, that contributes to this tremendous game? the music of this game is breath-taking. it puts you into the world with alto's eyes. all in all, on a scale to 1 to 5 i'd pick twenty. thank you to the developers of this game for creating such a fabulous game.
pritam mohanty : a must have minimalistic adventure game for everyone. simple yet beautiful design with awesome gameplay makes it hard to ignore from playing once downloaded from the playstore... so hurry up, go ahead & download this to play.
christiana kirov : beautiful graphics, and the sound effects and music make it even better. definitely 5 stars. i can tell a lot of work was put into this game.
luthfie s.a. : one of the best game i've played. i'm not a gamer at all but this game is addictive. could you please add the setting for the night/day. because i prefer to be in the day mode. i love to see the sun. thank you.
a.r achterberg : one of the, if not, the best game ever. everything about this game is flawless. the music is a wonderful piece of art. easy control, great music, amazing graphics with zooming style and the ability to take pictures while pausing is beyond magnificent. played it at the beginning of the year and still do. and will.
sophia young : simple yet satisfying. the graphics and the music are extremely well done,
and challenges keep it interesting to improve with every run. kudos to you
devs, you did a great job with this one.
jerome zaugg : probably the most beautiful graphics i've seen in a mobile game. a wonderful setting with a calm and relaxing soundtrack. the game is simple yet challenging and it does have a meditative effect.
sadeq heydarbakian : i have never seen a game so perfectly thought through by the developers. there is no flaw to mention. it's sheer joy and beauty.
sanjib mishra : absolutely fantastic, the music and the graphics just actually relax you and makes the game more enjoyable. eagerly waiting for the odyssey mode and the second part of the game.
nirosha liyanaarachchi : this is the best game ever. graphics are so beautiful, they attracts me in to it. every level is good and makes it even more harder. this game actually inspire people because of all the calm effects. i love alto's adventure.
charlesx13 : wow. the music was fantastic and the animations as well. it is the perfect game. it is an extremely simple game yet it is so captivating. i fell in love with this game immediately. i love how the creators have were able to keep the ads to a minimum. the ads only play when you want to continue your life after you die in the game. overall it is an amazing game !
hocus pocus : prime example of a well made game. everything from the sound design, animation, art, mechanics, to challenges and game modes shows the care and thought put into it. highly recommended.
azel joe : this game is so relieving and relaxing... especially the zen mode... in the regular gameplay the missions can be sometimes frustrating but it fun and challenging.
molly lowe : i love this app and have it for several months, pretty good for a person who is ridiculously hard to please when it comes to playing games. keep up with your amazing game ideas and creative zen. very much appreciated.
max s. : i absolutely enjoy the game. simple and relaxing. but i just noticed something, unless there is a trick i don't know how to do or something, but the character on the icon is flipping the wrong way, if he landed the trick his board would be backwards. just thought i'd point that out! great game!
bela zaborszky : i really enjoy the game, it's beautiful and subtle. i did find a few bugs / glitches though. whenever i die and the 'tap to continue' screen pops up i can just hit the multitask button on my phone and immediately go back to the app i'm revived and can just continue playing. also a few days ago i was mid-game and pressed the pause button after which i pressed my phones home button. when i went back to the app there was a pop-up screen that said:"thanks! 500 coins have been added" or something like that, after which i accepted those and experimented with hitting the multitasking button and then returning to the app again, it said the same thing once more. after repeating this for a few times it still worked. i don't really mind that these little bugs are in the game, but they do take away a bit of the challenge. hope this helps!
rawan : this game defines calm, relaxing gameplay. forget the rocky shooting games, come down to this! i "finished" the game, as in, completed all goals and unlocked all snowboarders. my favorite is maya; she's my perfect speed. good work on this game. it deserves more than it has.
infant antony shelton : best addictive game ever played. best ever game with just minimal graphics. hats off to background music and the concept. the climate and day changes really pleasing my heart.
diego vargas : a beautiful game. i take issue with the difficulty of avoiding obstacles at high speed, but, aside from that, it's truly very calming and satisfying to play. i look forward to alto's odyssey.
elias mohamad : amazing game, beautiful artistic graphics, relaxing music, doesn't force you to pay real money to enjoy, lots of fun with levels and challenges. one of the best games i've played on android.
alfred : it is a really fun game. i found something out though if you are about to close this app out then return to it, it gives you 500 free coins and thus can be repeated.
a google user : im just too addicted with this game! it's really intriguing and if you fall off a cliff or hit a rock, it's not that hard to revive the player, you just need to watch a fifteen-seconds long video to catch on with your game . and the challenges are awesome! altho sometimes its hard and annoying but overall it's thrilling
a google user : it is beautiful and addictive. i like simplistic controls in games and i like the endless runner part of it. it's fun and i hope i get to play alto's odyssey soon.
ye qian yeo : this game has to be one of the best games i have played in a long time. besides 2d games like geometry dash, this has to be another one of the best.
lasha nikolaishvili : the game is great but, there are several bugs, sometimes when i go fast or something like that the character stops picking up coins, lamas and power aps. sometimes the character isnt jumping when im trying to jump
pradeep prabhu : had this setting existed in real life. i would sell my house, quit job and ski all day long. calm music and on top of all zen mode. one of the best games on android platform after a very long time.
4 : this game teach me that there will be obstalces in your life but no matter what you have to rise again and again 'though this is the best game '

emily isn't a pedophile : if i could rate 7 stars or more, i would. the graphics and the game in total is smooth. it's very adictive and fun.
suhail khan : awesome game. love it. i do hope the devs can add more control to the jumps and backflip such as flipping in the other direction to prevent a failed backflip
bec khan : great game!!! my only problem with it was that the starting music is the same each time - i often died, so grew to quickly associate that music with failure - and that there aren't enough goals! (i recently completed the last one :)) if you are thinking of new characters, you could perhaps have one that was very fast but difficult to control?
a google user : i love this game is the best mobile game ever , becaus the gameplay and the graphics it's so cool like we are playing as a kid but it looks like a ninja (for me).if somewon dont like this game they are weird.
ohhello : this is honestly one of the best mobile games out there in my opinion. worth the 5 stars! the goals are hard but not impossible and the characters are unique and interesting to play around with. the music and sound is great and the game looks flawless. i just unlocked the last character and the game still feels fresh and new. i definitely recommend.
bowlerballer : this is the best game i've ever played on mobile, hands down, and the best endless runner game i've ever played. i would honestly pay to play this game, it's so good. the graphics and art style are incredible. the gameplay is exhilarating and after doing a great combo i feel a sense of euphoria that i've only ever experienced in real snowsports. thank you to everyone who made this game possible.
a google user : this game is wonderful. i like it. but after you learn how to play, it gets boring.
madison canezaro : great graphics, great gameplay, great game overall. i've loved this game since 2014 and i don't think i'll ever get tired of it. good job.
richard lowcock : fantastic game, i don't usually have the patience for endless runner games but this does it so elegantly that it becomes actually relaxing instead of simply frustrating. easily one of the best android games available.

soumyabrata das : it's amazing, beautiful and eye-catching art .love this type of art style in this game ,there is a small bug after exiting the game the music still playing in the background.. by so far love this game. wish you guys should make a game with story ,then it will be great masterpiece.
robert cosper : altos adventure is a great game, one of the best games you could ever play.

game.

kenneth chiu : it's really simple... sometimes though i think the characters are too imbalanced in other skills they are not specialized at.
tamanna gogia : this game is so engaging and so simple. anyone who's looking for something addictive but without the hassle of complicated controls should definitely install the chase engager!
pratyesh somani : dear alto team, it's really good game. but here is my suggestion for the chance of improvement. try to add an access of illuminance sensor of a mobile device when game played in day light, and according to lux accessed by sensor, alto's background theme must vary from morning to night. this will enable player to play the game very well in day time, as well as in the night.
astandardskrub : an fun and relaxing game that is just beautiful and jaw dropping. this game proves to many people that games are art and should be respected in the world.
shanmukh palanki : i love it its great. newly added zen mode is great. but it's better with same music as the normal game. if you would add same music as that of normal game to zen mode it would be great. the game is like a magical world. waiting for the odyssey.
yaswanth ram : this game could easily be called a peacemaker..the zen mode is the reason..to just go endlessly without any sense of urgency is truly peaceful..

victor aguiar : controls are great, the game itself is beyond amazing. you can zone out and relax yourself. use headphones

bolt - : simple gameplay, stunning graphics, and calming music. i have spent my time playing zen mode more frequently than the standard mode simply because of the music.

seyed hosseini : amazing art style, a lot of detail was put into this game. from the subtle shadow on the ground when alto jumps to the small animations in the birds that fly away to the sun rise and setting. this game has great game mechanics and design as well as the better implementation of ads. can recommend to anyone.

nick jones : to get 500 extra coins every 2 seconds, click the + button next to your total at the bottom of your screen. choose to watch a video then press your home button to minimise the game. press your game icon on the screen and game will pop back up with 500 coins rewarded. keep alternating between your home button and game icon and watch them rack up. :d
a google user : i normally find games like this dull and boring after a few minutes of playing but i absolutely love this game. it's minimalist design and easy to pick up controls makes it more of an experience than a game. as all you need is one finger tapping the screen to play, it makes you look and absorb the scenery which, although simplistic in design, i find it strangely calming
flotts : with a game development background, it's hard to see the mobile game scene and not laugh. most of the games lack even the most basic attention to detail and design consistency - it feels like the developers don't care. alto's adventure is mind-blowingly well made and some of the details that the developers focus on are even so small that most players won't notice. i was recommended this game by somebody who has an iphone and had to pay for it, and i wouldn't have minded having to pay for it myself. amazing.
dillen ekkerd : great game. it's obvious that the game makers took a lot of time and effort to create such an incredible game. it may have some buggs still hiding in some places, but none that can't be fixed. i personally love the "zen mode", it really does give the user a chance to appreciate the game without having to worry about scores and such.
artem smaznov : the game is simply beautiful. i say bring material design style everywhere. so nice to play, and the fluent time of day and ambient change - nice touch. was a bit hard to play at night at first but once you get used to it it's ok. played for a few days, and still want more. the game seems to be pretty demanding on the hardware so wouldn't be surprised if it wouldn't run on low end devices.
jade watt : i remember a little a while ago when i got this app, i was sitting in bed unable to sleep. i think i had a big test the next day and the worries of it prevented me from relaxing. then i remembered this app, i had only played it a couple times and without headphones. i decided to give it a go, so i went into zen mode and plugged on my headphones. i was so surprised about how relaxing it was. i played it for what felt like hours, i felt so much calmer. eventually i stopped it the game, my mind was now clear and i was able to get a good night's sleep. whenever i'm stressed i play this game to help me relax, the normal gameode is also enjoyable. 5 stars and i most definitely recommend it, the graphics and music are amazing.
george waller : there is nothing wrong with this game, i play so many games and on every one i think 'should be different,' but not altos adventure. it is simple yet intricate, easy yet difficult, and peaceful yet interesting. this app has been perfected, and everyone should use it.
marco darian : awesome! simple but addictive! awesome game but still have a lot of bugs.example:1.sometimes when i blow a llama horn near the chasm,all the llamas jump into the chasm! or sometimes when i crashes,my snowboard flies into the sky :v but i still love this game!
ca onizuka : i really loved its zen mode, the point that it gives you a option to just relax and go on a stroll without caring about achievements and challanges, just pure isolation, you and the beauty of mountains. also its a nice way to perfect your skills.
athanasios kyriazis : one of the greatest games i've played. can be played in a relaxing or intense manner according to your choice. nice environment music and effects.
shubham mandlekar : a very soothing and blissful experience. the graphics are serene and the background music is placating. it lures you into going there and relax.
gaurav pandey : men truly awesome combination of sound engineer and graphics devloper we r just loving the zen mode ever hats off..
julian lee : the video to continue run is super buggy. most times i just select end run. it either doesn't work or the video plays after but doesn't let you continue your run.
brandon p : this game takes the endless runner, a ridiculously simple premise for a game, and makes it something artistically beautiful. visually, it's reminiscent of a minimalistic version of portions of journey, complete with scarf.
kathy palmer : i love this game! not only are the graphics & music beautiful but the game play is smooth & glitch free on both my samsung tab 4 & my galaxy note 5. the game itself is calming & challenging (but not frustratingly so) @ the same time.this game is a rare gem indeed!!
geo : this game really goes to show how much you can do when you take a minimalistic approach. the sheer simplicity of control, elegant visuals and heart-warming audio make this game one of the greatest any mobile game player could possibly get their hands on. beauty is this game. amazing!
kristan : one of the best apps. it's a really good app to vibe out to when listening to music and also just playing.

daliya sarkar : what a game for time pass
prattush sethi : i returned to this game after 1 year and it has become mote awesome. i like the zen mode very much. the graphics are so soothing that sometimes in the zen mode i intentionally trip and keep sitting there to enjoy the changing colours of the game due to the passage of day and night in it. the music is a treat for the ears and removes any stress of the hectic schedule of whole day. hats off mr. nesbitt
nikolay borey : the game is great, but guys, please fix the bug where to revive character you watch a commercial but nothing happens and you have to start over again (had good wifi connection) or spend coins. and another one, when revive option appears, but you can't even watch commercial (no matter how many time once or several you click) and clock just disappear.
alen nalic : easy to learn and very responsive controls . simple but pretty graphics and sound (u can play your music app in the background too) you unlock different types of characters (fast one, quick back flips, high jumper etc...) very fun casual game . i play while on the metro or bus . only game i never uninstall . really worth a try . thanks to the producers. only negative is they recently added ads but although annoying they are not obtrusive as they come up now and then when you've just crashed and are starting over
red cloud : before i say anything, please fix the glitch where if your listening to 3rd party music the app turns the volume down a little bit and after the "premium version" has been added i've been having much more ads than i used to. this is paid on apple but not on android and i love that! i also love the animations and the art style of this game. the music gives it a nice touch and a good rhythm while your catching llamas and doing backflips.
christiaan j. b. : this must be the best mobile game to ever be made! if i could i would rate it 6 stars. adding a multiplayer feature, an endless mode (no coins to make it fair) and more music and environments would make the game more fun to play and attract more attention. i really hope you'll consider adding these features, i just know they'll make the game much better!
b mint : i was playing the display tablet thing at a apple store. saw this game, played it, loved it! so i asked my sis for a sharpie then wrote "altos adventure" i found it just now and i love this gamereeeeee
jamie hagenbuch : a wonderfully simple and visually pleasing action game where you snowboard down an endless mountain, chasing llamas, avoiding obstacles, collecting coins and pulling off astounding tricks. unlock different characters and upgrades and experience the ever changing nature in this highly replayable adventure.
shreyansh jain : for the ones who like a game not just for passing time but also to relax. get drowned in the most beautiful soundtrack on all of play store in the zen mode. and the sounds of rain and birds while skating. amazing. this is by far the most relaxing game i've played. a must have in our apps.
shounak : this game is a great mind refresher. going through beautiful landscape with
a nice music, leaving all the stress behind. sleepy ivory snow mountain,
beautiful sunrise, rain and snowfalls, peace is painted everywhere. skating
smoothly through all these, just gives a feeling of paradise.. it's not a
game, it's a fairy tale.
speedepitomised : altos adventure is amazing. racing down on a snowboard, chasing deer with snowflakes falling, lush trees above your head with a stunning backdrop of mountains and the sun slowly sinking over the horizon. great game to play when you just want a peaceful, no wifi game. nice job :)
reinis skujenieks : beautiful. a game that doesn't really need a lot of skill, but is very chill and calm. the game can be as difficult as you can make it. as a true searcher for a perfect game, this is one of my favourites. tru this b out! it's incredibly fun, ngl.
sonia zhou : i have no games on my phone and this game is the only one on my phone. i'm not a big game player, but this has changed the way i play games
arif syamsudin : a very amusing and entertaining. the only limitation playing this game is my hand capabilty of holding the handset. a bit of complain. this latest-update version is quite buggy. lots of restarting, especially when the in-app ads appear. please fix the problems. thank you
lone walling : this was amazing. see, these are the games the world needs. not only is the music beautiful, but the graphics and scenery are lovely and soothning, and yet the game is challenging. these are the games i look for. games like altos adventure and the trail. it's sad that i can only name two great games. bravo you guys. bravo.
th35leeper : old alto is a masterpiece! i'm on android 5.1.1 (old sony xperia tablet) and the 1.5.1 alto patch made my game unstable. this patch feels like some one who has never played alto is monetizing alto to fund odyssey. i get it and would love to play, or pay, for a great sequel. if it's the quality of alto's adventure, you can really feel the love that was put into the coding. wonderful procedural generation!! please continue to improve with new updates considering all devices players use. however i'm really happy that my google account works so well to save my progress. i was able to uninstall and install 1.4.4 from uptodown and keep my progress flawlessly with google account.
sudhangsu debnath : i think this is one awesome game. just except one thing. make the transitions from day to night and vice versa a little slower. rest awesome. keep up the good work.
nhat minh nguyen : can't tell how much i love this game. simple, yet beautiful and very satisfying. you can play this all day and all night long.
kaelin prusa : beautiful little game. cute alpacas, lol. couldn't have asked for a better zen mode, it's definitely one of my favorite apps to use to chill out. time of day and weather changes as you play keep every run like a new one.
prath : give us more updates on gameplay. waiting for the update. should have a story line or something to spice things up.maybe a career mode would be awesome.
avtar singh : awesome game but one problem. you should insert a program that we can play our own music during game play instead of default music
abhijay paul : honestly, the controls were a bit hard to grasp at first but once i got used it this game became out to me. with its great art style and satisfying stunts.
stuart paterson : absolutely fantastic game. my favourite mobile game. but i can't believe they added these type of ads. they're so invasive and frustrating they completely ruin the experience. there must be another way of doing it? i would pay the premium charge to remove them but that should be because i like the game, not because the ads are toxic
randy luhrs : beautiful game all around. controls are solid. the only thing that bothers me now are the ads =/
sterwin fernandez : hey this game really good and music so loved.. it's beautiful motivated one music.. when u play the this that time u feel very relaxing.. super game

manas soni : thus game is very helpful to releasing tention.and other thought. this is very addicted game.and thanx for do zen mod free.
anthony tsourounakis : controls simple to use, but takes time to master. graphics very good, but sometimes hard to see snowboarder clearly. (important to me if i want to land upright). music is appropriate and enjoyable to me.
cade : the game is brilliant, i love the graphics and the overall concept of the game, however i think it could be improved by adding more purchasable items such as clothing, colours or even new characters, i don't feel like the add free version is worth buying at the moment due to the lack of purchasable items, but as soon as more items and such is added, it will be a must buy for me!
a google user : very nice simplistic game, the controls are really smooth and the graphics are very nice, not too sharp.
jestami : it's cool to see such a great game come from such a small company stationed in my home city (saskatoon). keep it up guys. this is my favorite game by far from you.
david orr : terrific game, but a few nagging bugs. frequently, after choosing to watch a video to extend life, the resume game function will not work. also, the jump function randomly decides not to work - typically at the beginning of a game, not in the middle of a game i've started.
pratyusha amanchi : in all honesty, this is the best game i've played. the zen mode is another level altogether. good going guys! thank you for this wonderful experience.
obada ojjeh : this game puts me in a happy mood. i would definitely suggest to play it in zen node (endless)
stoked artist : i loved the game it's very smooth gameplay is great but is it 3d if it is can y'all make it hd.but please make and hd option and a 3d option in the options menu that would be really helpful if people wanted to play in 3d or hd.
floppakg : i have this on my windows 10 i pad and everything else it's the best ski game ever

patrick biegun : amazing, you have to get this game. one of the best games i have ever played, great graphics, gameplay, controls, and it's really addicting
yak : beautiful to play. simultaneously challenging and relaxing. beware the premium upgrade: you lose the two free revives. i thought they'd be ad free after upgrading, but instead they're gone and you have to spend significant gold on apparently one-use revive items instead.
a google user : absolutely stunning graphics -- i could play this game every day and notice something new each time. the music is also enchanting; i listen to the hour-long loops on youtube. definitely worth the download.
robbie rolfe : calming way to go to sleep if you cannot get off your phone at night.

john roger amos : i like the game soooo addictive but pleaseeee i advise u guys eho haven't been updating the game pleaseee don't update it because it will only just make you fell annoyed. ads everywhere

ellen battin : this game was perfect until the last update. now the graphics for the coins, rocks, and close up trees are blocky and i keep hitting rocks because they're indistinguishable from the landscape. what happened? other than that, amazing game!

nishchhal bakshi : this is my first ever review on google play store, till now i have never thought of writing a review but this game is the best, literally it is a masterpiece. this has so amazing use of graphics and the music takes you to the world of alto. dont worry i am not a paid review and i dont even know these guys. totally genuine review, i hope i could give this game more than 5 stars.
monsieur meme : incredible game. graphics are beautiful, very calming. love the different characters you can unlock, and all the quests. absolutely in love with the zen mode. the smooth gameplay and amazing soundtrack just melt my stress away. by far my favorite game, had it for months and don't plan to ever delete it (a rare thing for me). will stick around for a long time.
douglas : okay, i'm going to give you a great description of this game. first of all , in the design group there must be a man in his 50s that still smokes cannabis. which makes this unique game friken awesome. this game actually puts you in a good mood. if you surf for ski or snowboard you understand the dynamics of this game and the movements of the controls. i find myself playing this game when i'm at my most stressed i'm dis-pleased with daily protocol askew points...and it brings me back. way to go girls .
stephen lander : really good game. totally beautiful and fun. for the devs, a few issues i've noticed: smashing through a rock or fire after you've used the llama horn causes some really funky graphics issues when using the hover power up, you can pass through other powerups or coins without collecting them
jason carrington : i have never played a more perfect runner. then again i have not played many runners that don't feel repetitive and purchase-driven. this one doesn't - the only extra of necessity is possibly the coin-doubler. the atmosphere is sublime and soothing, with a beautifil geometric art style. runs like a dream, controls are easy and efficient, and it's easy on the eyes.
matthew valdiviezo : this game is really great. absolutely love it. i have found one flaw/bug however: if you are knocked off of your snowboard and fly into a chasm without hitting the ground, your screen will focus on the chasm and not change. you have to restart the app at that point. other than that pretty much perfect!
a google user : it is hands down the most beautifully made game i have played. very pleasant background music, lovely graphics and best of all it is highly immersive and distraction free. it does not have pathetic and annoying popup ads anywhere. it does not force you to make any in-app purchase (although can be done for some upgrades) but they don't nag. worth playing with headphones on as the sound quality is aces. and of course the game control is top notch. it's one of the highest standard of mobile game development in my opinion as it focus primarily on best user experience.
jbhawks : simple. clever. amazingly beautiful. it's a game that brings peace and calmness instead of tension and anger. also loved that the game has missions, but doesn't focus on them. instead, you focus on the beauty of the action, it is really breathtaking. that moment when you fail, of course, makes you upset, but not because you've lost some points or progress and stuff, but because the action and motion have stopped. it is a supreme job. definitely ranking 5 stars. brilliant.
gaming practitioner : possibly the best mobile game i have ever played! just the beautiful handcrafted animation and slick gameplay is so well done. on top of that zen mode is a great and thoughtful addition to get lost in the beauty of the mesmerizing scenery. i can go on forever but to sum it up ijust love this game so much
dakshitha wijeratne : well, alto's adventure is not just a game but it's something that makes my mind peaceful in times. the best 2d world i've seen in an android game but even more best thing is the natural sounds it has blended with music. the zen mode with headsets on is really peaceful and i loved it. more creative games like this noodlecake... thanks
varsha singh : this game perfectly captures the aesthetic beauty of the nature. the changing seasons, the rising sun, the twilight, the snow, the thunder, the ringing bells everything sounds so realistic. to top everything off, the soothing music comes to the rescue. i love to play this game in 'zen mode' after a stressful day at work, calms my soul down!
abigail tan : love the game, it has great gameplay and visuals. if you don't want ads, turn wi-fi off before opening the game because it doesn't need internet. you don't need a lot of coins to progress and it's a very good immersive (and free) game that you can spend a long time playing.
a google user : beautifully made game and not one you expect to be so pretty and wallpaper worthy. controls are easy to understand and missions are really well balanced. like a mix between jetpack joyride, tiny wings and journey. honestly the best mobile game i've ever played. just... try it yourself
a google user : this game is truly incredible. the scenery is absolutely gorgeous and it makes you feel like you are rushing through the chilly atmosphere of nepal. flawless game play, it has never once lagged and the snowboarding felt smooth. this game helps me relax and i cannot truly express how impressed i am towards the developers.
spottus : backflipping is a little hard to do, but you can get into the hang of it and it will run smoothly, i just downloaded the app yesterday and i'm having so much fun, the graphics are abstract and the music is relaxing and sounds beautiful. hope you take my review as a good recommendation and who knows, maybe i'll race you!
chiyo sumizome : never played anything like this before. love the controls, music, and the graphics. very comforting and calming. some of the quests are really tough to do, but it's extremely satisfying when you finish them. i don't know how the devs nailed this game so well. someone needs to try their techniques. favorite game of all time. awesome and addicting.
reisy : best game i have ever played on a phone. absolutely amazing! the gameplay is a temple run, jetpack joyride style, but this game offers the most serene music with breathtaking backgrounds. i could play this for hours on end solely due to the relaxation it provides. like a few comments already made, it makes you want to cry because the scenes are so full of... home! it is a full adventure and i will never get bored of this game. thanks alto!
abc gamer : oh boy oh boy do i love this game. alto's adventure may belong to a genre saturated with uninspired and dull games but it's simplistic design and tight controls make for an incredible experience:- graphics- alto's adventure may not boast of high res graphics but it's elegant and simply beautiful art style more than makes up for it. controls: the controls are simple but tight and responsive and actually works very well with alto's trick system. it's the perfect example of mobile controls done right(by being simplistic instead of having clunky dpads ) general gameplay and replayability: like many other games of the genre alto's adventure offers a challenge and level up system but it's real replayability comes from its soothing calm nature(best evident in the game's zen mode) , character variety and it's very satisfying trick system( each trick feels rewarding due to the boost offered by it and thus lets it serves a role in gameplay as well as final score)
zoe molnar : i love the graphics and its music! challenging and addictive, well designed game and characters. zen mode is a nice bonus! the only disadvantage is that on my current phone (xiaomi mi5 with nugat) the online mode e.g. watching videos for bonuses/reviving characters doesn't work.
e. feusi : this game is amazing! the graphics and sound effects are smooth, and the music is beautiful. a lot of people are complaining about how 'there is only a backflip' and 'escaping the elder is impossible', but they fail to realize that tricks give you speed! there are many different stunts you can accomplish on the snowboard. overall, i think this is one of the best apps out there, and would get a higher score if people actually understand how to play it! it is very challenging, and you must time your jumps and flips perfectly in order to accomplish them. even if you aren't interested in snowboarding, this game is still a must-have.
david julio wang : tears. this game brings tears to my eyes. it ought to be recommended to anyone, but especially to someone who is feeling sad. the sound of the board smoothly plying its way through the soft powdery snow, the soothing music of thoughtful cellos, enlivened with the bright energy of violins, a steady current of piano scales carrying the player down the mountain as his or her problems are left behind far up the slope. tip : i just found this myself, swipe from the right side on the home screen to find the zen mode. no score. no game over. just the sounds of the mountain, a meditative musical score, and your own drifting awareness. so peaceful. it feels like meditation. i wonder if one could reach nirvana playing this game? ah well, namaste fellow gamers and seekers of a peaceful adventure.
brian clarke : not what i was expecting. i thought alto was a kangaroo (based on the google play store icon) an this was just another side scroller with a cutesy character to control. had no idea that alto was a snowboarder shown upside down in the icon, his 'tail' actually his scarf. now i feel like i missed out on this game for so long. truly a master work.
chew ch : this is the best adventure game i ever have! the graphics, musics and gameplay - everything are so beautiful! as the level rises, the goals given are becoming more and more challenging, which makes me can't stop playing at all. plus, i am so eager to unlock new characters because exploring each one's advantage is quite a fun thing to do! i love the zen mode too because of it's peaceful atmosphere.
chris howden : fun snowboard game, could use improvements. i love the simple clean graphics and great artistic style. i looove the izel character...1000 bonus points for having more than one female character, and someone who could be interpreted as queer to boot! thank you! i do wish there were more tricks you could do earlier in the game. a few grabs or a way to mod the grinds would be nice. and night/rainy mode are waaay too dark. i like the variation, but you don't get a bonus for "surviving" it and it's definitely tougher. i can only see that tiny dark figure when i am inside in low light, which makes landing (esp in trees) frustrating. but overall, great game.
josh montgomery : with the new zen mode added i was able to take in a lot of feelings about this merely simple game. it opened my eyes and reminded me that life doesn't need to be so crazy and stressful. filled with worries about schooling, work, relationships, etc. we have the power to live the life we desire. we have the power to be happy. we are free in this beautiful world and instead of worrying about things that don't really matter we should be out in this amazing world so we can truly live our lives to the fullest.
sourish bhattacharya : that is the best game i have ever found in internet. it clearly shows how the sun sets and moon rises up and vice versa. so guys, give me notation on other games which the owner of alto is going to make.
ting : simply sublime, now i never give 5*s mainly because nothing ever comes close but to the development team i say bravo you've done a spectacular job! and that is from your toughest critique. everything runs smoothly, controls are simple and responsive, the concept is infuriatingly addictive in a good way, a timeless classic i can't praise enough. my one request and i'm being picky is please add some other tricks other than the back flip, maybe an outrun avalanche mode see how far you can get but i want royalties for any ideas used other than that it is a master piece.
dane zeke liergaard : this is the only mobile game i've ever not muted. this is because the music ties perfectly into what i like about this game: it is wonderfully, masterfully zen. playing it is so relaxing, i can feel stress flaking away as i tumble and flip down the mountain. very, very well crafted.
ivan rosenfeld : phenomenal game and incredibly beautiful gameplay. i don't recall downloading a game this good. one minor thing that i don't mind but i just want to state is: the landing after a back-flip. devs can you take note about making the turning radius a bit faster or the area of the snowboard larger?
t.t. perez : love the game! it's very clean and smooth. not too loud and busy like some other games, which is a huge turn off for me. this game is just simple that delivers big gameplay. a rarity this day and age. however during peak hours the ad button lags. i refuse to pay 1500 coins to continue, lol. finally unlocked the last character -- the speed, the jumps, the flips -- outstanding!! nevertheless i kind of wish they can do more than back flips. something like front flips and corkscrews! but free falling seemingly hundreds of feet through giant trees beats it.
nithin thomas : loved it so much, relaxing.. so simple game but awesome graphics n images.. superb high quality background music in which u will feel it s raining actually when played with a quality over ear headphone..
robert hundrieser : ok i'm not one for online reviews mostly because people will ignore it but this game changed everything. this is the most gorgeous mobile game i've played. the scenery is so beautiful i sometimes get lost. haha the music is so peaceful and calming that i dont mind listening to the sounds while playing. i love how it doesn't spam you with ads everytime you die. it's a simple endless runner with amazing graphics and music. i love the sense mode. i can play for hours!!! it's seriously a must download!!!!!
nande donny : it is so awsome and relaxing. i mean, it is easy, it is peaceful and you catch lamas. it is very good to play when you feel bad. but i want people to play the zen mode. it is really peaceful espeacially if you use your ear phone. so people who just got back from a frusted day, play this game and use the zen mode with your earphones.
nerdikon : this game is by far my favorite, i love it. the graphics are simple and aesthetically pleasing, and when combined with the wonderful and calming music, it turns into a masterpiece. the gameplay is fun and is a great way to get rid of stress, especially when playing zen mode. the developers have done a great job with this game.
syam lal : thumbs up to developer of this beautiful game. great idea guys. especially the background music are a treat to listen. those transition from sunrise to sunset and then to night just blown my mind..i have played a lot of games...but this is the first time a game had given me both visual and audio treat together.. my favorite is playing in those night time when moon is glowing up and i just skii away and away... just one glich i had is that, on my xiaomi redmi, i can't watch videos to extend a run.
unknown user : i love this game. i love the artstyle, the music, the gameplay, i love everything about it. do you guys know pinstripe? it's a pc game about a father who lost his daughter through alcoholism. but it tells you the thing with the alcohol at the end of the story. pinstripe is th villian and...this game is too long to describe. just watch it on youtube, it's worth it. please make some kind of adventure game, like pinstripe. i would absolutely download it. thank you.
abigailfails : the aesthetics are amazing and the controls are really intuitive, along with solid gameplay! some goals seem ridiculously difficult yet i always find myself trying again all the same; when i actually acheive them it feels amazing. of course, it is possible to skip these goals for a small fee of in-game coins if you don't like this intensity, yet i seem to have an unwritten philosophy of never doing so that i have yet been unable to bring myself to break, which is why this game drives me mad sometimes. in a good way though! one small nitpick i have is how long it takes to get back after you crashed - it'd be great if there was an option to just automatically start a new game. but apart from that, amazing game! :)
adeeb imthiaz : an amazing game a beautiful and simple interface and controls. the effects like lighting are marvelous and simple. the music is also really relaxing and beautiful and it's such an amazing game :)
roy thirstly : wonderful, wonderful game. no intrusive ads, no pay to win, just a pretty,
fun game. but on the app icon, there's a boarder with their scarf flowing
right to left, but the boarder is moving from right to left, and doing a
front flip. in the game, you move from left to right and do backflips, and
your scarf goes from right to left.
ric gibson : this has been my go-to game for months now. many others have come and gone, but this is the one i've kept on my phone the longest. it's the first game i've worked to unlock all the achievements in. very fun, not too complicated..a good game.
russell fletcher : very zen game with great gameplay to boot. one odd glitch is when playing following using chromecast, when chromecast returns to screensaver mode the in game sound cuts out.
andrew cook : fun simple and really relaxing...i love the music and the day night transition could you please put a story mode to it... but we (the players) would have to do something to unlock it and that players can choose which mode they want p.s. i lice your zen mode
fabi cellini : this game is a beast. i really dont play games in phone but this is good to cut my time. so simple and stylish. i like the graphics and background. night theme is nice, moon and stars. real thing is the slowmotion while doing backflips. good good!
louis strydom : probably me favorite game out there. have had this app for almost a year. still love it. the music and sound effects is one of it's best features.
abhinav rathore : simple but intuitive game...with brilliant gameplay and specially the weather effects. please add facebook login option so that we can compete with our fb friends. also see if multiplayer can be added. by the way hats off to u guys who made such a brilliant game !
logan teague : this game is so relaxing... it's my go to after dealing with a load of stress. the music is fun and adventurous, the graphics are phenomenal, and the gameplay is far from expected. updates or not, i am excited to see what comes next.
christian reyes : most addictive game i have ever played, the goals are intense, and the scenery with the weather and if your busting out combos looks intensifying.
ayden rusher : this was the most beautiful game i've ever played. you should wear earbuds or headphones no matter what mode. i think this game deserves an award for prettiest game
nadine miller : the only issue i have is that i have is the dark screen. its hard for me yo see. otherwise its a great game.
john r esaknder : one of the best and most beautiful games i have ever seen in my life. the controls are great too. the ads are not annoying and are not obligatory.
nadir : completed all goals, took around a year since i didn't play it very much,
but i loved it all the way from beginning to end.
a google user : amazing graphics and audio effects. sometimes it's difficult to spot the player but otherwise it's great in terms of graphics an performance.
jamie wood : it was wonderfully peaceful and relaxing. when i needed a break or wanted a distraction, i'd open up alto's adventure and be pulled away from my reality. this game has made me feel better on countless occasions
marta szydowska : the game is just wonderful. starting from the simple, but beautiful graphics, pleasurable delicate music, lastly, no advertisement and a fact that the game runs smoothly. the playing experience is indescribably great. and the most beautiful moments are sunrises and sunsets. big hugs for the creators
haley flk : i completely love this game, the controls are simple and easy, and the graphics give me a nice cozy feeling. it's relaxing but still challenging. i wish i could walk around and explore things. i would love to see an expansive world with this game!
taylor pio : fantastic core gameplay that i just keep coming back to. most mobile games don't offer enough to hold my attention for more than a few days, but alto's adventure just stands out. a great game to relax with.
pal singh mann : omg ....such a good game. the game is so beautiful the sceneries are so gorgeous that u feel like u r there. above all the music is so sweet and calm. whenever like i am stressed or tired i just put my headphones on and i am relaxed like i am on a vacation. thanks....for this amazing game. keep up the the good work.
alicia jacquelin : this game has saved me from so many awkward situations, absolutely love it. just wish there was more to do after the goals have been accomplished
nekoreapurr : i get the realism of the water making you faster but i'd prefer glowing arrows that could be placed on snow or ramps to make people zoom.
jeri 2.0 : i'm speechless this game is gorgeous, its all i could ask for, i couldn't suggest this game more than i do. thank you for this amazing game
doug finlay : works great on my op3 but have noticed recently that magnets don't always work now. that is both new magnets picked up and top up magnets when already in the mode.

dark mage21 : this game is so much fun to play. it has great graphics and really nice music, especially in zen mode. but i found two glitches. one is when i collect the stampede horn and my screen starts flipping around a lot but stops after a second. another is when i land after doing a combo and i boost into a magnet, for some reason when i do that it doesn't collect it. other then that, amazing game.
trent damon : there is a perfect balance between difficulty and pay off. there is plenty satisfying elements within this game other than a high score. the rush to escape an elder, collecting a full row of coins, slapping llamas, everything you do before the "play again" screen appears makes this game worth playing. also ads do not appear unless you want to watch a video for free coins.
chris : this is my favourite mobile game ever. graphics are gorgeous, music is well suited, the gradual increase in difficulty of the challenges is perfectly scaled, the different characters all have unique skills that make them suitable for different achievements... i could go on and on. most of all, this game wins for the beautiful simplicity of the game play. i can play it with one hand. too many games over complicate the controls. i would also add that i find this game really relaxing to play, even when i wipe out. and i love that adverts are optional. just a fantastic game. the recent zen mode update is a welcome addition. would love some new pick-ups and upgrades, like something that switches your rider mid-run, or new things to spend my coins on. awesome game.
leapedbeforelooking : omg. this game has outstanding graphics and the controls are easy. overall, though, is that is is highly addictive. it even helps me relax. 5 stars is undereating it. then, i tried zen mode. i had just found out about it and for the first time i listened to the sound. i soon realized i was crying. that was be cause i recently took in a lot of stress. in zen mode i was able to let all that stress out. the best part was that i wasn't sad, i was just relaxed.
gabby valenciano : it's a masterful work of art.. any lack or addition of complexity to it would ruin its beauty. the concept is simple, playable and emotional enough to appreciate the breathtaking sceneries and mezmerizing instrumental music. (no change in gameplay but adding more similarly themed instrumentals would be more appreciated)
nightywulf : amazing, stunning, indescribable graphics of course. zen mode woo!~ gameplay however is stale, with typical ads for in-game money. barely any upgrades as far as i can tell either, compared to most infinite runners. however, support/controls for newbies is great, with adecent tutorial and plenty of leaderboard tabs. but this game is really just for the graphics, i could do zen mode all day. ooh~ a nice game for offline play.
hussien elshamy : excellent game, relaxing, beautiful and addictive, all together. just one thing, you may put a counter or tell us how far we have gone in zen mode ... it's like a practice so i need to know how many meters i made . just this and thanks for making such beautiful game
archie miller : it's such a simple, but creative designed game and is so easy to go about rather than like some games you have so much to pay attention to, and it is so fun to play as it is just you snowboarding down the (scandinavian styled) countryside. 5* as it is just a brilliant game that must've taken to programme, design and build. also it's such a relaxing game to play and is just a nice game to play to almost get away from daily discomforts. peaceful, creative, fun. from archie.m.miller
juicerupper : this is the best gaming app i have ever downloaded. everything from the simplic yet beautiful graphics and art style to the game play itself. it truly is a game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. however it can get repetitive on extended plays, but is mitigated by the randomly generated slopes. zen mode is an excellent addition to this game. it removes most distractions so that you can enjoy the game at its core. all in all this game, while not perfect, scores high marks in my book and i would gladly recommend it to anyone.
rob g : fun game perfect for touchscreen. very addictive and enough challenges to keep you going even after unlocking everything. on a galaxy 7 edge i think pressing down on the screen too hard on this game caused the screen to develop a pink line. so take it easy, the controls are responsive enough.
izzi c : i don't usually do reviews, but alto is pretty dang incredible. i've never seen a better app. the game is challenging but not frustrating, with great goals and a cute premise of llama catching, and zen mode is surprisingly fun! the graphics and sounds are beautiful, and the cycles of weather and time give the setting a good amount of variety. i've never had an issue with ads because they're not intrusive, and i've never experienced any sort of glitchy controls. wish i could give it more stars.
yohan chandrasukmana : this game is amazing. i first watched the gameplay on a video that recommended games for android and i thought, wow this one looks awesome with the minimalist graphics. so i started playing the game. what i first noticed from the game after playing the tutorial was how the graphics and gameplay was so smooth and it was fun to play, even though noodlecake wasn't the first developer which made a platformer-ski game with simple controls for mobile phones. then the music started playing. i almost cried. it was so relaxing and beautiful and it fits the game's minimalist theme. after that i noticed that there is a day and night mode and it was so beautiful and very creative. i haven't went so far in to the game but i hope that noodlecake can add a few modes such as multiplayer and add more characters into the game, even though the game itself is already gorgeously done. i also hope that noodlecake studios can make more games like this, games that has a certain theme and all aspects of the game such as gameplay, graphics, environment, music, and controls follow the game's theme. keep up the good work!
zion nimchuk : easily one of the best mobile games i've played. the devs nailed the environment, and the attention to detail is fenomal, from the llama's ears flapping in the wind to the lights on the houses dynamically turning on and off as the sun goes up and down. gameplay is simple like jetpack joyride but has a higher skill ceiling, with backflips and the wingsuit when you get skilled enough. the unlockable characters add incentive to continue playing and the acheivments make every run challenging. they devs also managed to make the game incredible peaceful, and if you want a really good example of that try out zen mode.
snehashis gharai : the best game i ever played. when i completed the the tutorial and go back to the menu , it shows to swipe left to go endless mode. i swiped and i saw that 'headphone recommended'. first i start it without headphones and soundless. but wneh i connect my heasphone and listen the music , i really feel relaxed........then i played it 1 hour without pause the game..i can't understand when the time runsout. i can't understand how can i explain that how i am feel when i play it in the endless mode with headphones. the day cycle and the season cycle of the game is feels me like a real scene...i really really loved it.
nathan kennedy : i love this game and all but it has one bug, so one time i wanted to revie myself so i clicked "watch a video" but that didn't work so i pressed 1,500 so then i get revied then a second later it plays the video. money wasted. ok that was me just ranting but i really love this game the music and art style is so... whats the word "awesome"!
ankit jangid : man.. i wish if i could give 10 stars to this. this game has great things in every aspect. taking from the graphics, gameplay, sound effects and their instantly swapping and effects. seriously i've never seen a game before that. hats off to the noodlecake studios and to the team.
a google user : this game is one of my favorite and i will never uninstall this. im a gamer i played a lot but this game blow me up. nice graphics, amazing gameplay, nice sounds and a lot more. it helps me chill whenever im stress out. i soooo love the developers. ty for this game and for new update. congrats
piyush shah : i had thought this to be some poor game with ok-ok graphics. but now i am
totally hooked to it! only bug i found is that if i try to 'watch video' to
revive when there is no internet, the error message comes much later when i
start the next run.
king arthur : amazing graphically designed game. has a few bugs but nothing to worry about. edit: amazing soundtrack as well, just love to play this game, so much fun. one of the best games i have ever played for mobile. just excellent experience.
j sharky f : the atmosphere of this world is quite amazing. it has symmetry. it has a kind of meditative peace to it - while, at times, being hilariously difficult to acheive all the goals. i did find some glitches during the game - especially when the green horn is used. the screen tends to flicker at that point as if this cascade of llamas is too much for the game to handle. or is this some kind of over-exuberant earthquake effect? overall, a great game with a lot of replay value.
lee : this game is so amazing. i'm shocked this doesn't cost money. there is almost no ads to be found. if i could rate this game higher i would.
michael charles : this game is addictive and a great time killer too. the graphics and sounds are so well designed. and some moments like flying with a wing suit are breathtaking. i love it.
davor arsic : great relaxing game with very nice graphics, music and sound effects. characters with different abilities. i love to play this game whenever i have a chance.
tom shelley : easily one of the best mobile games i've ever played. doesn't require you to pay to be able to do everything. controls are easy to learn and hard to master. i find myself constantly coming back for more. it's also very calming and i love the soundtrack!
dani fogel : in my opinion where this game really shines is the zen mode. zero distractions,just the true beauty of this piece of art. well done.
taylor bec : guys this is a wonderful game. the music is relaxing, the backgrounds are so scenic and pretty. the sound effects are great too. keep up the good work!
jennifer hilton : i can't play spotify and this game at the same time. this game is amazing but spotify will always win so please fix this asap.
josh mcgonigal : this game is awesome especially when you have the wing suit i'm trying to get the lama horn now but it's a really fun game.
a google user : such a gorgeous game on so many levels! the graphics are amazing and the music, beautiful in its own right, fits so well. together the art and music create this breathtaking atmosphere and environment that you have the pleasure to traverse though. the movement is so smooth, one of the many reasons playing this game is so satisfying.
jitin : good n relaxing. wing suit controls are a bit wonky but other than that its a nice game
jim pattison : such a great game. the missions keep you interested and help develop your skills. i would play this all day if i didn't have to work
shaik babajan : the background sounds of the game are so pleasant and resemble the heaven
like experience. alto... is a simple and spectacular game i have ever
played. the changes in levels and the weather makes the game more
interesting and mystical. i simply state that this game is a master piece.
eviltyres : for starters this game is not for you if you want crazy tricks and action. this game shines because i can respect the work put into it, especially the art design and music. a must get if you can appreciate the work put into the game. this really comes into play in zen mode
zinny guy : i love this game. soothing and addictive. it would be even better if you add like a way to play with others. like a race mode
faisal al-bandar : terrific game, nice landscapes, every run is different (procedurally generated) and the gameplay is smooth and satisfying. only complaint is that it causes my phone (galaxy s4) to overheat after about 15 minutes.
i need to start studying. : the non-competitive mode is very relaxing, especially the graphics and the background music. helped me relieve stress before an important test ;)
callum love : this game is freaking incredible! i'm pretty sure i rated everything 5 stars. i love just plugging my earphones in and playing zen mode. the rain sounds so real! noodlecake studios, you've done it again...
jay cathcart : one on my favorite mobile games. it has smooth, simplistic graphics and addictive gameplay.
paran sharma : absolutely beautiful game and even beautiful ost. for someone who loves mountains, snow and such soothing music, this game is a must play. reminds me of the times i was up in the mountains. absolutely beautiful.
amos barren : can't find any awesome game like this .this game gave me an expirence that 3d games doesn't give
john mcgrael : i'm sort of a cynic when it comes to phone games, but this one is so good... it's perfectly simple, done so beautifully, from the graphics to the sound, and is just challenging enough to keep you hooked but not frustrate you
messias aron kor : my friend recommended it and yes it's fustrating some times but hell i love this game...
seinor sloth : such a peaceful game and not to mention fun. minutes turn into hours and hours turn into days. favourite game i've ever played on my phone and i think everyone should try it
daniel cottontail : i have never written a game app review, usually only take them half heartedly, but this is a great game, great controls, challenging but not too hard, not many ads at all, and just very realistic to the movement of skiing. i mean it, very worth it. great job to the creators of this game
a google user : just so beautiful and addictive. please, please don't turn this into an angry birds advertising travesty. let me buy it without ads. i love this game and don't want to see it ruined by ads.
brennan perdue : this is the ultimate feel good game. its not so much about the gameplay, but it's about the beauty of the game and the music and surroundings and the day and night. this is the only game on my phone i would call a complete masterpeice.
damien stone : this is such a stunning game. the tasks that need to be completed to increase levels aren't too tricky but may take a little bit to complete while waiting for the right section of map... not that it bothers me being that aesthetically amazing and the zen mode is just perfect for that.
loic iglesias : perfect, but just a bug when you smash a rock and you are in the midst of a llama group called with the llama corn the display does very big vibration. i think it's the sum of the vibration of the llama corn and when you smash a rock
rachel : love love love this game. great to unwind after a stressful day. i have nothing negative to say.
pratik shrestha : simplicity at its best. a perfect relaxing peaceful yet challenging game. play it for the wonderful experience it offers. big thumbs up to the devs
austin gorchs : one of they few games i haven't gotten tired of. very fun. i highly reccomend it.
pooja yadav : the zen mode in the game is just awesome. this game speaks life.the graphics and the music accompany each other very well. stress relieving and fun to play. no ads too.
haroon subair : giving less points because i lost all my earned characters when by mistake replay tutorials was clicked. now the first character is coming in the latest level.
srinivas : didn't like falling in zen mode with the music so beautiful and endless feel, wish there were no obstacles.
morgan kesler : fun platform kind of game, i've reached level 50 but keep playing cause it is still quite fun.
dhimas a. prabowo : im a fan of this game but it seems that the icon had misplaced alto's flip which is actually should be in counter clockwise and im bothered bcs of it smh
irfan mian : this game is the best game i have ever played 5 out of 5 on everything. i love the is game to bits and the music is the best thing about the game. the graphics are phenomenal and again i love this game so much!!

sayvon wilson : great game, good graphics, perfect time killer it's very addictive i love this game. and i am in love with the soundtrack i could listen to it without the game but it fits so well. i wish there was a story mode though.
heyits me : i didn't know games could be so lovely. i love how the sun rises and slowly sets and the weather changes regardless of whether you start over. its relaxing but sometimes challenging. its addictive. i love it.
vicky a : this game is stunning. it's music is amazing, especially zen mode, and it's graphics are beautiful and so well thought out. going as far as to put in all the seasons, and different natural disasters? you guys, seriously deserve all the credit
mongoose : speechless, this game is just wonderful. one thing, can you please just keep updating this, you should put more wonderful soundtracks, a couple more bioms and maybe a bit more colour just to spice it up a bit, but well done on this game.
osi osi : this game make me happy as every time i play it. to me the music always gives of a very very relaxing vibe and i just love how each character is very unique
x- skyfrost : this game is amazing,but i can't jump over a tall chasms

tony quinones : pros: rewarding and challenging. stunning visuals and music. very atmospheric and peaceful i love this game. cons: unfortunately gets repetitive after a few months of playing. wish there were more tricks to perform

tyson reese : the music and graphics are so amazing! i love the thunder storms and i'm so glad this game is now on android!
stewart gavin : well what can i say? brilliant game play with amazing sound i could listen to the sound and relax! good little missions, the only thing i can't get used to is the flight suit! i also think that as well as zen mode there should be a trick mode with a dedicated course! well done noodlecake 5 stars!!!!!
jo : this game is so much fun and ever since i downloaded it i have never deleted it. it is very beautiful and vivid, and even thought the controls are very simple, you can still lose yourself in this wonderful little game.
moni null : fun and absolutely gorgeous. some of the challenges are very hard but they actually let you earn enough coins to buy your way out instead of forcing you to try and fail a zillion times.
noha abdelraouf : i have a problem with level 32 where i have to wingsuit for 200m in one run, i did it many times for longer than 200m but it didn't pass or accept it as goal achieved i don't know why!!! otherwise this game is awesome

macey giles : i completed this game and unlocked everything and it was amazing. the pace takes some getting used to, i sucked at it the first few times but you get really good and it's so much fun to get new characters. reminds me of robot unicorn attack only more soft and lovely and with way more fun and easily achievable rewards.
ltreat : i uninstalled this game months ago for storage purposes and having come back to it full of fond memories, i didn't expect this game to be even better than it was before. zen mode is something i never knew i wanted and i simply adore everything about this game. from the beautiful graphics and stunning music, this game will leave you with an experience you won't regret and only make you want to come back for more.
maxwell dyirakumunda : this game is nothing like i have ever played, it is fun, it has good effects and the night and day is just spectacular. i love it when you are boarding and then some guy comes and chases, you just get absolute fun. zen mode is another thing, it is so nice even if you don't want to be scored or gamed so if you are looking for a adventurous relaxing game this is the one to get.
erin ferguson : this game is meant to be enjoyed, not to be frustrating or impossible. the music is relaxing, the graphics are pleasing, and the game itself challenging without the need for money-mining in-app purchases. if you're having trouble passing a goal, you can skip it with coins. if you fall down, you can get back up without using coins. and if you don't have coins, you can watch ads for some more. in this way, ads are not forced upon you during game play. the zen mode is the perfect way to hone your skills.
kaustav ganguly : exactly what a mobile video game should be after a hectic day. beautiful to look at, the tricks are so satisfying when the snowboard lands perfect and the day night cycle is the thing which makes this unique. the attention to detail is superb yet the overall minimalism is sublime and calming. zen mode is love. love the soundtrack too. not like those tacky run game music. it's a beautiful place to be at the end of a busy day.
terry wang : there's not much to do once you've finished the game. i'd like it if there was some kind of "marathon mode" that would be unlocked after completing all 180 goals, which challenges you to complete as many goals again in a single run. or some sort of "new game+" mode.
ethan dunn : this game is beautifully crafted and developed. it couldn't be executed in a better way. the ads are in the forms of videos to revive alto. so there's no unnecessary span that takes away from the experience. the graphics are unlike any other mobile game i've seen. the attention to detail and smoothness coincide perfectly to create a perfect gaming experience. the nature of the game is in a sense exciting, but the way to execute the objective is relaxing and calming to the senses.
alex nolen : have had it for over a year now, and still is my favorite app game i've ever played. beautiful art style, magnificent, music, and such fun game play. no other game like it is both so fun and soothing. new updates have been great, adding zen mode. i am personally not a fan of being able to pay coins or watch ads to continue runs, because it just feels like cheating compared to playing it before you could do so. overall fantastic game, and absolutely recommend to anybody and everybody.
william kew : this game combines elements from two of my all-time favourites; journey, and olli olli. esthetically beautiful, great music, and simple yet effective controls make this game very pleasing. it's an endless snowboarding game that relies on the players input to perform tricks and avoid obstacles. levels change (procedurally, maybe) which makes this game about focus and reaction speed rather than memorization and muscle memory. great game.
jake charlson : i find this game very relaxing, i'm not sure i would call it a fun game, but i can't get enough of it and it's definitely enjoyable. this is also the only game that i intentionally turn the sound on for. every single other game i play is muted because they sound terrible, but this one is great. to top it all off, it is incredibly beautiful and polished. you should definitely give it a try.
alex red : love this game. very visually beautiful and simple play yet a lot of fun. only issue is that the watch ad system is a bit buggy and sometimes doesn't work or takes a good few minutes to work or causes the game to freeze briefly on the continue screen (but the end game button still works fine).
steven scibetta : i have no problems with games that have minor bugs, especially when they are as beautiful and addicting as this one. however, with the latest update, in-game ads have started appearing. i realize that developers need money, so if these only appeared at game launch, i'd be totally okay with that. however, i have twice now had my app crash in the middle of very good runs due to ads appearing in the middle of my game. i will change this back to a 5 once it's fixed, but until then, i wish i had never updated.
kristina kusnierova : i love the simple and beautiful design, it doesn't have annoying ads, music and sounds are calm and nice, and it doesn't get too fast to handle as you advance in the game. challenging, but not annoyingly difficult. definitely purchase the windsuit especially if you have troubles with maya and big chasms. i'd like if we could buy more stuff in workshop. still one of the best games.
zak bradow : but when i do it has to be for good reason. i can say that you'll love this game. its smooth stylish graphics and great sounds make it an easy game to play over and over. it has easy challenges that will make you try over and over again. and the best part is they don't ask you over and over to rate them. i came here just to say how good they are on my own.
nothis realname : this game is almost perfect. the game play lends itself to replayability, allowing hours of entertainment and challenge. the integration of adds is subtle and they can easily be avoided, or watched to get a quick revive or more in game coins. the only fault i find is in the menu ui. some menu options require multiple taps to take effect. i've had this game for months and keep playing.
a google user : on the surface, alto's might seem a far too simple side scrolling game. but there are layers of subtle complexity - that doesn't necessarily involve game mechanics - that really accentuates the gameplay experience. the music, the graphics, the changing time of day and my favorite the zen mode. all of this makes alto's a compelling try. well done noodlecake studios. thumbs up.
a google user : a true masterpiece. the sound of cold breeze whirling past your ear, the snow, the mountainous backdrop, the transition from dawn to dusk, the dark sky dotted with shiny little stars, the adorable crescent moon, the warm golden lamps, the cosy little huts, the scarf and the music! i could just lose myself in this dreamy little land. a slight bug: snapshots get overwritten. please fix it.
merrill : zen mode is the best - wish there was a separate stat screen for zen. i love that you can skip tasks - i'm barely able to beat an elder once in a race. love the last unlock abilities, but i wish the last two characters were swapped, so the ll is the best. when i crash in zen mode near some birds - i watch the sun or moon for a while + listen to the bells + hoofs crunching snow. graphics 5/5 soundtrack 5/5 foley 5/5
brad terp : excellent game and runs very smooth. very intuitive controls (being as simple as they need to be) and above that its fun. the challenges will keep you going and some really do get troublesome and push you to get better. overall i love it. would recomend, even if you dont stick with it.
a google user : there's a bit of a hole in my life at the moment because i finished alto a few weeks ago. i need more challenges, is there any plans for an update with more stuff to do because im gettin withdrawal symptoms here! also, this game is essentially tupa's adventure for me cos i haven't used alto in forever
a google user : this game is so relaxing and the gameplay is entertaining, the graphics are beautiful and impressing for a simple app like this one, and to top it all off there is even a zen mode in the game! one more thing; the audio makes it two times better. soothing music and nature sounds to accompany you as you glide down an endless mountain! there is barely any ads as well!
a google user : a great fun simple game with beautiful graphics that cycle through day and night along with some weather conditions. gameplay is simple and fun. each unlockable character gives a new perspective on the gameplay. i can't recommend it enough. some issues with ad integration and not responding properly at times but rarely interrupts gameplay
zy jerasca : alto's is a great design of the simple endless run game mechanic. with multiple characters to unlock and power ups to upgrade you can change the way you play. the mountian is never the same twice so there is no memorizing patterns, it's just you and the mountain.
rouget francis : i love this game so much but lost my game process i unlocked 4 characters already my game just restart by itself please help or if you cant its still ok i was wonder if you could like add more classic music in the zen mode thanks for reading
janilyn : i can state so many reasons why this app is labeled "editor's choice". i love everything from this app, especially the new zen mode, feel like i could travel miles from my tab and meditate. the graphics is good, looks simple but it just matches my type. nothing i would complain about. worth trying. thank you staff, keep up your good work. i will definitely recommend this. so, five stars for you. (if possible, i would give a thousand :") )
yuumeezee : fantastic game that is well deserving of the editor's choice. graphics are minimalistic but beautiful. game play is repetitive, but the procedurly generated environment manages to change things up a bit. soundtrack is soothing and beautiful, especially in zen mode. (i may be going a bit on a stretch, but it seems like it has a nice homage to journey). all in all, a well done game.
kartik verma : as you can see the reviews below it is relaxing , gorgeous, and comes with beautiful music. but i want to tell you something that while playing this game i forgot the time the place and my mind was lost in music scenes and my mind was fully relaxed .i had seen games that are good but this game is mind friendly and i was feeling that i am alto before playing this game my mind was full stressed full of anger after i played game i was fully refreshed
austin johnson : frankly, those games advertising about having the best graphic on mobile and whatever else, are really superficial. this is one of those games which try to go over the top with "next-gen graphics," but has created a game which has epitomized what a good mobile game should be. relaxing and slightly challenging. also the soundtrack is awesome, and happen to listen to the track which plays during zen mode, on spotify. by far the best mobile game on the app store (besides minecraft. ).
andy leigh : just excellent. goals are well structured, it's always fun, new characters are unlocked frequently, and on top of that it's gorgeous to look at and listen to. it'd be good if there were a few more power up options, even paid ones, and there are a few times where the play again button doesn't do anything, but overall there's nothing to detract from the five stars.
maks godek : the game is absolutely amazing. the graphics, the atmosphere and music - all are doing great job together. it keeps the player focused while he/she can relax simuntaneously. my only wish is to be able to do front flips - it would be better to have that mid-air control.
connor fraher : this is one of, if not the best game noodlecake studios has ever had a hand in. the music, most notably, is incredibly entrancing and provides a perfect backdrop to the stunning visuals, crisp sound effects, and simplistic ui. the gameplay itself is rewarding, easy, and fun. there aren't a lot of major changes as the game goes on, but as the player learns, they can twist the subtle changes to ramp up their own experience with the game. overall, one of the best free games i've ever downloaded.
gibran ashraf : this is a really refreshing take on the linear gameplay mode with simple but great graphics coupled with awesome game design and mechanics that stay true to physics. the cherry on top is the new zen mode. easily the best and most soothing thing after a hard day. deserves more than 5 stars to be honest. will share with my friends - not something i say for a lot of things
daniel patrick : the minimalist art style is truly beautiful and it combines with a calming soundtrack and simple one touch control system to make an endless runner(snowboarder) game that for once feels relaxed and not panicked. there are no pop up ads or waiting for upgrades to take effect, nor any neccessary in-app purchases just to play properly, unlike so many other games. complete objectives to unlock new characters and go into "zen mode" for an even more relaxing experience. i can't recommend it enough.
a google user : easily my favourite mobile game and the one i've invested most time into. insanely fun and addictive and gorgeously designed. in the last week have had two people watch me playing over my shoulder. that mountain aesthetic instantly grabs you. and that score, especially the track for zen mode! simply masterful. sad that the little helmets are only on the amazon version (presumably my save / progress wouldn't transfer?)
hai-qality : i'm speechless, this is an absolute masterpiece. the gameplay is simple yet fun. the visual, graphics, scenery is so beautiful that you can play hours of this game without getting bored. the music is calm and soothing, perfect for the game. the developer even provide a zen mode which you can play the game endlessly without dying from the obstacles or enemies. overall this is the best game i've ever played.
swata das : this game is not addictive. it's like meditation. i can imagine the makers trying to make us players feel what it is to live in the vicinity of absolute beauty. the zen mode is a welcome addition. the scenery, the music, the visuals are inexplicably calming. there's not enough words to frame into praise for this. thank you for giving us the opportunity of being part of alto's adventure.
alex b : a simple, solid, smooth and incredibly fun game crafted with beautiful audio and visuals. i'm not sure why it's named after a starting character you'll only ever use for the first 20mins lol i've hit maximum level now so uninstalling, but will my eyes peeled for an update or sequel. very impressive, guys. keep it up!
noah purdy : what isn't to love about this game? amazing graphics, simple yet addicting objective, the goals are not too challenging but not too easy, and the advertisements are just available for extra coins or a life. there is the occasional visual glitch for a fraction of a second when i smash through a rock every once in awhile, but that is easily excusable by the quality of this game. keep up the good work devs!
matthew anderson : if only more developers made games like this. no annoying popups, no annoying rate me, no need to spend money to play. i bought the one item you can buy and have gotten my money's worth 100x over. now my go to games for 20 mins relaxing. music is brilliant too. awesome game in this genre.
brianna schutte : i love this game! the graphics are so beautiful and the way the game is set up is so relaxing and super enjoyable. i like the soundtrack too! however, at some points the game gets almost impossible. but ya know what? i suck at games and i am sure other people didn't have that problem. all in all, this is a wonderful game! you guys did a great job!
sidney grimm : fantastic game that deserves more than free to play with in-app purchases. this is a game that you spend money for, so it's a privilege to have it free. my favorite part is the zen mode where you can endlessly play to the music and sounds of the mountains. this is a fantastic game for anyone to enjoy.
needstamina : this game just feels like... if it wasnt a game, gliding trough the snowy mountains with simple but incredible views with an incredible music, just feels so relaxing, it makes you play forever, i'm just stuck at this game, its just... there are no words to express myself. this game is as good as it is now and doesn't need any improvement. thanks creators for this brilliant piece of art ;)
andrew chicks : this game is fantastic. the art style is simplistic yet beautiful, the story is cute, and the music is phenomenal. there aren't many power up options, but that doesn't hinder the game's performance at all. i'd say that this game has a lot of potential, while still being amazing.
christopher kevin : didn't even hesitate to play this again from zero (because there is no cloud save but it's alrite mate) after buying a new phone. i'll never get bored. (but at least give it some major updates) nice, heartwarming and soothing graphic and audio. everybody must play this game!
doctorwho35 : this os by fat the best game i've downloaded! so simple and calming. i love playing this game and the all-new zen mode is a great way to practice the timing of your jumps/backflips etc and a fun way to play without "extra worries" or distractions. would highly recommend.
luuk vogel : this game is simply amazing. sound design is awesome, art style looks amazing and the gameplay is simple but addictive. probably the best game on mobile period. i have a few tips so the game can become even better than it already is - maybe add an hard mode or something similar - maybe add some more characters and missions - there is a bug when you hit a llama and a rock at the same time your screen glitches out and does a flip i've had this happen to me multiple times
sam fennell : i can't really fault alto.. it is simply beautiful and my go-to game when i need to unwind. my only issue is the all time high scores. i've topped the weekly with 1.2 million (bbouncy) but any idea of making my way onto the all time is out of the question. i've read about a patch that increased the games difficulty (that would explain the crazy high scores from before!). developers, would it be possible in any way to establish an all time 'post patch' list?! love alto! i suggest you all download.
dream weaver : this is one of the best phone games i have ever played. gameplay is very simple, yet rewarding and addicting. it has a certain flow to it that is quite enjoyable and relaxing. the level of challenges isn't over the top, so it keeps you feeling good at the game while still providing some nice obstacles. i also really like that for a free game, it isn't too in your face about in app purchases. i feel like i am getting a good game without having to spend, yet the upsell are still cool for expanding the game.
miss riya : first i didn't had any idea thought an another coin collecting game but wow! this is best!! very soothing to both eyes and ears. i always feel so relaxed after playing. graphics,music,game play everythings so smooth like butter. alto rocked me shocked
bekiteru : this is the best coolest and most relaxing game i've ever play. alto's adventure is one of my favourite game of all time. never get bores even when playing it again and again. i love everything about alto's adventure but just one tiny problem. sometimes the background music stuck and even stop the music. what happened? i hope u can fix it as soon as possible. my phone is samsung j5. i hope for a new update soon because i am really looking forward for it. update suggestion = add more characters
crexius : the music and graphics are incredible the controls are incredibly simple no forced ads. i play on my tablet, so i cannot envision how this would scale but it looks incredible oh my 12.2in tablet
freyja kim : now i know why this is an editors' choice. the music, the art, the gameplay. everything is awesome and addicting. i just can't stop playing it because it's calming and thrilling at the same time. sometimes "watch videos" doesn't work. i wonder if there's a limit to the videos one can watch to continue playing per range of time? but it doesn't bother me much. the elder chase is just the best (the best part of the gameplay, i'd daresay!). the sunrise, too. there's nothing beats backflipping with sunrise as the background.
chloe softpaws : originally downloaded this game to crunch through some easy gp xp, and have decided to keep it. its a fun, easy, laid back game with a good pace, nice simplistic graphics and enough goals in the gameplay to make you want to get better and coming back for more. 5/5
elijah bowen : this game is just perfection. and i'm not saying that just because, i'm saying it because everything in this game is good. from the characters, to the music, to the controls. zen mode in itself is straight perfection, the music is gorgeous. this game has brought me back to night snowboarding, carving my way down the mountain never looking back just living in the moment. this game is beautiful in every way, play it with headphones!
dakoda koziol : the gameplay is ok, but i can play this all day long just to listen to the beautiful music and stare at the stunning scenery. and who's idea was it to make it change time and weather? they deserve a medal! it's such a beautiful game... [edit] i was gonna say that zen mode is unnecessary, that the regular game mode was already very 'zen' (and it is)- but then i heard the soundtrack. stunning! absolutely beautiful. you guys just leave it where it is. :)
andres rodriguez : i know it sounds contradictory, but this game truly relaxes you and, at the same time, can be very exciting at moments. visually beautiful, with nice sound effects and music. it's amazing that it's for free. five stars without a doubt. no glitches nor bugs... it runs smoothly in an lg g4.
joshua asmus : now i am not one to play on mobile games (mostly because a lot of them are poor quality) but this game has one of the best soundtracks ever. this is not super challenging game but at the same time, not a breeze either (no pun intended). if you are on the play store looking for a very simple, yet relaxing game. you found it.
off key kazoo : it's an amazing game in general. graphics are really good, runs extremely well, controls are good, but here's thi thing. i would like it if you would save the photos directly into the gallery. like make a new folder for it or something. since it is a tedious job to move it all the time.
a google user : now that i've passed level 19, i can leave a positive review... that 2x triple backflip goal nearly killed my enthusiasm for the game! but, it did improve my skill. this is a beautiful, mesmerizing game. it seems easy, yet remains challenging. the scoring and advancement are well structured, even for those that have not paid. you just wanna play -- either for points, or relaxing zen. i note that the buttons to restart or advance runs are not as responsive as they should be, on my moto x 2015.
jacob mueller : the game is really beautiful to play and the replayability is very high. it's frustrating sometimes to play the game at night because it looks so good during the daytime i feel like when i play for an extended period of time mainly i'm playing an almost completely dark game.
dian atamyanov : the artwork, the music, the seamless gameplay, it all flows so well. this game is a rare gem. i wrote that when the game first came out. it's even more true now with all the polish. zen mode is absolutely perfect for those of us that want to unwind while playing.
n.c bal : this is the most beautiful game . even the musical background seems so delightful ... you guys rock and on to the other hand this game is too damn flawless.. hoi.. just one thing add some more soothing sound asleep melody.. again... whoever made this game, you guys are awesome man
rhada m. : i don't ever rate apps, but this app has really caught me. the graphics are great, the music is awesome too, the gameplay is simple yet addictive and relaxing at the same time. plus there is a zen mode to sink yourself with the music and the mountain. i love it, i recommended it to my friends. probably the downpart i noticed is that sometimes the sponsored videos are unavailable so i have to start the game over again. but it's really an issue. generally, this app is worth downloading. <3
everett hamilton : my coworker and i got so competitive with this game, we would find empty rooms at work and sit down for an hour playing. this is a guy who works so hard he frequently skips lunch. after beating this game we tried hard to find another game to battle with but haven't found any with the playability that let's you binge like alto.
a google user : this game is a masterpiece that is a perfect blend of art, and fun. first, this game is goddamn beautiful! the environment's artwork is stunning, and the music is some of the best and most atmospheric i've ever heard! second, the gameplay is fun and fluent and makes you pay attention to your surroundings. and zen mode, it just compliments the atmosphere even more. when i played it, i immediately fell in love with the game! overall, my favorite mobile game of all time.
aaron ahles : one of my top 5 mobile games of all time. gameplay is a snap, the challenges are just the right amount of fun and frustrating (lol) -- but more importantly for this game, it's nearly aesthetically flawless. the visuals, while not graphically complex, are stunning: there's nothing like seeing the first sunburst at morning when you're doing a triple backflip down a huge slope. the ambient sounds as well as the music are first rate as well. you will definitely want to follow their suggestion and use headphones in zen mode.
richard sosa : whenever i get stressed, sad, anxiety, or when i start to panic this game calms me down so well and i thank you guys for putting so much effort into it... the game itself is beautiful and whenever i have my bad days this game is the highlight of those bad days... thank you so much... you are amazing. you probably won't read this but this game just means a lot to me...
note : absolutely love this game ,i can't put it down, game play is simple ,music is amazing, no.ads popping up other than the fact you can watch a video or use tokens to continue your run. love it ! i get pretty far most times and am.a.level 47 ,just don't want the game to.end when i get that last character! thanks for the most addictive game !
lauren amada : over the years, i've played many games and they were all fun and thrilling, but this one's different. for one, time passes meaning it can go from night to day and day to night. i also love that there are so many obstacles including the mountain elders who are really hard to escape (once you do, you'll feel accomplished). of course, my favorite thing has to be zen mode. i've been very stressed and when i played it, i felt relaxed for the first time in a long time (i almost cried). basically, get this game.
disha saha : i never thought a game could make such a beautiful difference in my life
until i downloaded this. it's almost spiritual-----calming you down as well
as exhilarating you at the same time. the snow clad mountains, soothing
music, the beautiful llamas together make it the best app on my phone.
shona o'neill : this game is a must have, it is amazing, one of my favourite apps so far.......and that is saying something considering i love my games, my guilty pleasure (game apps). i would recommend this stunningly beautiful, and yet soothingly calming (at times) game to anyone and everyone. it truly is at the top of my games list. also for everyone whinging about how it doesn't work well for your nexus, get a better phone, it's not rocket science, everyone knows they are rubbish!
aidan daly : this game just makes me happy. the music is just fantastic, in combination with the brilliant scenery it gives me a somewhat euphoric feeling. and you might think - its just another mobile game. but in this case its had so much thought put into it, and it really shows. fantastic way to implement ads - they're not shoved in your face! instead you've given us an option to watch ads so we can carry on twice if we accidentally dont jump over that rock, and in doing so we support you! so a win - win situation :)
nideesh k.a : don't know how much hours i spend for this... it's really a time killer and uff that music makes a real effect and greatest graphics.. good work to the team.. we all need such kind of games.. no unusual ads in app purchases.. really hats off developers. thanks for present us such a lovely game
andrew fitch : i knew within a few seconds of opening this app that i had found something special. truly a work of art and more than just a game, it's an experience! the music, atmosphere, weather effects, day/night cycle. try this game! and my mind was blown when i found zen mode, because it's exactly what i wanted. huge thanks to the developers! amazing way to relax and in all honestly it can get me a little emotional it's so beautiful
dave wilson : a single control makes it suitable for everyone, but choosing the right character for the current challenges is key. nice that it doesn't hassle you to buy extras, and that you dint need to do so to complete the challenges either. can't recommend enough
caelan hill : i have played this game for almost a month now and have loved every single moment. thanks for creating such a masterpiece. note: sometimes the llama horn makes the screen flip/go crazy for a few frames, it has caused a few unwanted deaths.
kevin matlock : a gorgeous, atmospheric game which is easy to pick up and hard to put down. lots of challenges and a stress-free zen mode should make everyone happy. definitely one of my favorite android games.
max guenther : not only is the gameplay fun, but the goals are just the right difficulty, the artwork is amazing, and the calm music is the cherry on top of the cake. it just makes it a great way to pass time, and the app doesn't even take up much space, and the battery drain is minimal. the story is unique, and the introduction of new characters throughout the level gains makes it so that you can look forward to completing goals. great job, noodlecake!
mike mudrow : i really enjoy this game. the graphics are beautiful and the concept feels original. even the in-game advertising is handled very tastefully. i have tons of fun playing this game. it is definitely one if the coolest endless runners out there.
chronical varsity : beautiful. snowboarding across brilliant tranquil scenery through an endless mountain of adventure, through day and night, whilst saving llamas and doing back flips. beautiful music and just stunning graphics, such a simple game but so beautiful. i want to write more, but for now i just want my review in to support the devs. they really deserve it. the music is so beautiful, i swear i'm going to make a piano cover on it. zen mode is especially awesome, will play before/while in bed. so beautiful....
5a8r3 : very well made and fair. not begging for your money. thought it was a little boring till i realised there were other chars to unlock. now i have 4th boarder this game has really opened up. good to see there are at a few devs who care about their audience
adam bede : alto's adventure is a great casual game for when you're bored. no forced ads and definitely not a "money grab", the game delivers a relaxing snowboarding platformer. and though it looks simple, the gameplay is enjoyable, and will keep you busy for a while. ;)
vesna song : at first the game is very boring. but once i start unlocking things, the game is pretty fun. best thing about the game is that it have an ending and i can just free roam after i beat all the missions. pretty cool since most game now don't have any ending. also very relaxing game.
sebastian vetterlein : beautiful design, smooth, great soundtrack, day and night mode. also haven't encountered a single iap yet, the "watch video" button is unobtrusive, and there's so few (no) ads i totally forgot to mention their non-presence until i saw it in another review.
tristen unrau : i've been playing this since it was first released for ios, and am very happy it's available for android now that i've made the switch. alto's adventure is one of only two mobile games i ever play, and it never gets old. it runs a wee bit slow on my galaxy j3 6, but still playable. i bought the golden scarf to support the devs. thank you for the many hours of joyful gaming <3
tmd sir : the 2nd character (maya) is the best- ive used her all the way to leve 43. her quick backflips make the difference between a 17,000m run, and having to watch an ad to revive. the 3rd character keeps his speed longer, the 4th character has fire special effects, and the 5th character is a llama that can double jump. all i know is the 6th charcter is an elder himself, and better be op. this game kicks ass
jacob stewsir : it's the little touches that make a good app great, and alto's adventure has everything you could want in a free app. no pop-up ads, smooth, authentic feeling gameplay, and a relaxed yet exciting fun factor all make alto's adventure one of the best apps out there.
enigma : amazing game,its peaceful somewhat and i bet this could be used for therapy,... i just wish the alto and other characters as well had ragdoll like effects, it would be nice for it to be dramatic or have some form of animation when he crashes and gets up (geez, it would be awesome if he walks to get his snowboard)..just a little animation would be great. but this game is just at another level. zen mode is awesome, would be awesomer if we could customize the settings (rocks suck in zen mode)
sarah huntley : i rarely ever leave reviews on apps because they are typically uninstalled within the first week. i have had alto for months and it never ceases to amaze me. i deal with extreme stress and depression at times, and playing this game helps me settle my thoughts and emotions. with the new addition of zen mode (which i just tried today) i could safely say i have never played a more relaxing and stress free game in my life. i'm almost emotional by how calm and collected i felt by playing this game.
manik raj sunarya : the moment i discovered #altosadventure, i knew what great ui i am seeing to. so serene, so tranquil. whenever you feel low, just slide through breathtaking slopes on your board & let the magic take you to state of trance. soundtrack, effects, day-night rolling, colors, wow. this is more than a game, believe me ! #loveit
fuckles the enchilada : i love this game! the gameplay is addicting, the music and sound effects are on point, and nothing feels unfair. however, i only gave this game a 4/5 because of one major issue i have: how come you can't listen to your own audio, (like say podcasts or music or whatever) and play your game on the same device? i used to be able to do it but after what might've been the last update i can't. please consider fixing this as i love your game and i and probably many others (maybe) would like this feature to come back.
joseph listing : the wing suit is the best for ridiculous combos, i love daisy-chaining loops and flips. it took a while to beat the last few goals, and i did skip a few at one point, overall a great game.
elizabeth bein : not only did i find this game very addicting but i also found it extremely relaxing. the music is beautiful in game and if you play the zen mode it becomes even more beautiful. this game helps me relax and i can play it for hours, and actually have, on end.
aneeshan sain : the music.. the scenery.. its a soothing experience.. i never write a review.. but this game kinda forced me to write one.. the most interesting feature is the 'zen' part that lets you keep the competitive spirit at bay and just flow down the snow in rain, or soft sunshine without any worries.. loved it.
ga31 gamer : if i you, you should download this game. there are many reasons of why to, but the one i would say is that it is the most unique game ever. the only other game that i could relate to this game is another called "crowman and wolfboy." come to think of it. they both have outstanding graphics, unique gameplay, and different game controls. that is all i have to say.
d3rp d4mag3 : wonderful game. i had this quite a long time ago and thought i'd leave a
review. this is one of those apps that becomes a staple of mobile gaming.
it has a challenge mode, relax mode where you can't die, and has
collectable llamas... you'll find out... anyway i loved it and the control
scheme is basically tap to jump, hold to flip. simple and clean, just how i
like controls to be. fun, relaxing, challenging, and addictive. the premise
of the game is that alto's llamas escaped and you have to snowboard after
them dodging all sorts of obstacles like rocks and pits.
cj terrence umekwe : i can't say how much i love it, the zen mode is just so serene and does take you on an adventure. considering the fact i listen to ambient mellow music, really magical. if more songs could be added, it'll be more than amazing. job well done.
alexis georgi : after a while we become the player gliding through the snowy mountains.. i have played many games, but none of them gave this feel ! dont forget to use headset while playing. no violence or competition. its so calm & relaxing. most of the time i'm smiling while playing this game ! :) its the first game i smiled when i crashed ! zen mode is so good, should try before going to bed. sweeeeet...
a google user : i love this game! super addictive and fun all packed into a simple but sweet game. however, i do have three suggestions for this game. one is to be able to upgrade alto's flip speed for a large amount of coins. second suggestion is to give players a small amount of coins for each challenge completed. third and final is to make the patrol horseman guys speed a fraction slower. without these small additions, the game is till one of a kind and crazy fun! definitely recommend!
talal arshad : i installed this game yesterday, i was literally shocked to see the simplicity and beauty of the game... but my photos are not saved in sdcard as i dont have it... i want to switch it to internal storage so my photos are saved, please tell me a way to overcome this situation... i have a tablet that is of alcatel one touch... thanks
a google user : i had this on my first 2 phones,my kindle fire,and in this phone and ive never even though about delelting thibg,this game is so amazing,worth any award it gets and im not kissing ass here,its worth any time devoted towards it,i loved it made my time
panda tar : i don't often rate or write a review but i had to for this game. it is simply amazing! i love that there are no forced ads, no asking for ratings and no in app purchases you need to advance. huge ups for all that! now the game itself; absolutely gorgeous graphics, the gameplay is very smooth and satisfying. yes its a simple game, yet challenging enough to keep my interest in it. it's a perfect game for passing some time with. my only complaint is that at night the rocks can be difficult to spot. i love it!
kirill yegorov : this is the game that i'm never deleting from my device. still can't believe it's free since it's perfectly crafted and extremely fun to play. the smoothness of animation and physics really fascinates me, i used to play for hours and hours, but since i collected all the heroes the challenging part faded away. however i still play from time to time, it's the app to go when i need to clear my mind or think about something, or calm down, can't recommend enough. the creators are geniuses!
sean blouch : in a world of cookie cutter lazy apps, this one stands out. the most striking thing about it is the phenomenal art and sound design. simple but deep with changing backgrounds that feel like you're really on a journey through the country. can't recommend this enough!!!
grace : this is my new favourite game!! seriously good. breath-taking music, incredible graphics and hypnotising scenery. the only thing that annoys me is sometimes there are too many rocks one after the other and it disrupts the flow of the game. i dont mind some rocks but just not loads one after the other. thank you for an amazing game!!!
detective h2o : i have had this game since it came out on google play, and i cannot compare it to any other game on the google play store because that would just be unfair. that's how good this game is! i love it! when i look for new and interesting games on the play store, my expectations for them are they have to have levels of both fun and awesomeness that rivals or are on par with alto' s adventure (that hasn't happened yet). this is definitely the best game this app store has to offer and thank god that it's free.
chris uglow : everything about this game is well made: the artistic graphics, the relaxing music the smooth dynamics, the achievable but challenging goals. my only criticism is that it's night time more often than day time which makes it hard to avoid rocks.
naveen kaushik : this is by far the most awesome game (if you wanna call it a game) . for me, it's an experience, a path to ditch all the hassles and drown into the serenity of the landscape. music is soothing, controls are easy and characters are beautiful. wjat more can i expect. perfect to the core!
xpl0ding gamrguy : i love everything about this game. from the stunning art, to the relaxing soundtrack, and the amazingly calming zen mode, this game has it all. i highly reccomend it to anyone and everyone who can enjoy a great game that relieves stress and provides hours of fun. my only regret is that i didn't find this game sooner.
charlize a. : this app is so surprisingly addictive! ever since i downloaded this app, i don't even want to stop playing ! the graphics are so perfect, the music and sound effects are so realistic! i highly recommend this app to whoever loves adventure this app is so relaxing and help get my stress away like gosh keep up the good work!
kalin warren : this game is a work of art. it's relatively ad-free. there is usually one on the title screen that you can make go away so it's not obtrusive. once you're past that, you're not forced to watch abby ads, and that may be my favorite part....besides the simple, addictive gameplay.
rolando quezada : please optimize performance for dell venue 8 7000. gameplay can be a bit choppy\laggy can tell drop frames. please update. i've tried with gpu hardware acceleration on and off and same thing.
munkee boy : this game is awesome. i jacked my job so i can play it all day. it's better than my mrs. she's ok but this game makes her look shite. if this game could make sammiches i think i'd have met my soul mate.
a google user : i was hesitant about downloading this game but i'm super glad i did, it's exactly what i need after a hard day. the gameplay is simple yet still exciting, the music is calming and alto is basically too adorable to miss out on. and the llamas? enough said, get this app.
frank c : not so challenging you throw the phone away, not so easy it's pointless. excellent balance of flow gameplay and wonderful atmospheric sounds and music. zen mode is particularly wonderful. well done folks, you made a blinder!
bohdai citta : a perfect blend of fun and simple, the challenges are great, the controls are good and easy. more games should be as well designed as this
snappy science : i'm not one to write reviews but this game is one of the most visually stunning and atmospheric i have ever played. zen mode is particularly magical and super relaxing for an action game. the soundtrack, especially in zen mode is unbelievable. if you don't download this game, your life ain't complete. never deleting it.
lanre ayangbile : altos adventure is a fantastic single button game for mobile. great graphics, great score and great challenges. should keep gamers going for a while. wish list- more characters and challenges. maybe a sort of challenge course mode
cozy weather : this game is well made, contains little to no bugs, has fun levels and doesn't hound you with ads for being a free game or want you to buy everything. you can watch ads to revive yourself up to 2 times, but all of the ads are max 30 seconds so you can just set the phone down and take a break before it ends. this is what all free games should be like!
dilanka mohotti : the gameplay,the music... the sounds all are very soothing and love the new zen mode where you can play without any score or goals to complete but just snowboard as long as you want listening to the calming ambient music.and now no lagging after the last update which is great! suggestion : please make the rocks more visible at night time if you can....
abbadoo02 : this game is really fun, i love that there is some thrill when being chased by the llama rider! this game has its own unique art style, especially when it comes to landscapes. i could play this all day, this is by far the games i will most likely play when on the go!
mac&cheese : i would freaking give million stars for this , the music is so relaxing and i play this all the time, it's fun and one of the best games in this world . keep blasting
jake zaleski : this game is amazing. it's very relaxing, and the music/sound effects go with it nicely. zen mode is an excellent idea, and also a lot of fun. i would definitely recommend this, and i hope you get it!
james henderson : no ads, no hidden costs, just a great fun well made game. no faults at all. it is clear the person that designed this knows what they doing. can't wait for alto 2
jonathan senn : very good game with very few flaws. i enjoyed it quite a lot. my only complaint would be that there's no way to keep my progress on another device, as i lost my phone and don't want to play through all the levels to get to where i was.
matt guynn : has become my peace whenever i am stressed or overthinking. zen mode is the best thing this game could have done.
roshan patel : very laid back game, easy to play and just the right difficulty to make it enjoyable. the visual style and sounds complement the style of game perfectly. great game.
kassed : i love the app, it's very polished and beautiful, a joy to play. the game mechanics are simple but addictive. the sound design is amazing, very immersive and relaxing. the ads in the game are very unobtrusive and minimal so that it doesn't mar the gorgeous design. i highly recommend downloading this game.
bao : alone, this game is stunningly beautiful and immersive. however, zen mode makes this game even greater with its great, relaxing soundtrack and simple gameplay. great stress reliever.
organized chaos : what to say about this beautiful and comforting game with limited words... it's very well designed and the gameplay is very well made and smart. the art is breathtaking and simple! if you are having a bad day and feel tense, i recommend you this beautiful game! 5/5
karan mehta : words cannot describe such critical thinking. salute to the creator! the choice of music is incredibly amazing. there is no other game that can make your mind feel the peace. overall i would give it a rating of 100/100 :)
angelm3296 : the music is calming and something i want to use to go to sleep at night. the scenery and graphics are just absolutely beautiful. this is such a good game and a great time killer like if you were in a waiting room or you are just bored.
abhra mandal : it is a good game if you want to fall asleep in the zen mode... however .. it would had been better if there were more music tracks instread of only one repeated ..
karoly deak : very nice game. altough sometimes the watch an ad to continue function shows me the ad but the game won't continue. it would be nice not to watch ads for nothing.
scott speers : this game doesn't try to be outstanding, which is what makes it outstanding. the simple story is clean and complete, the user interface is seamlessly integrated into mobile. the visuals are unique and stunning, the physics are good but could be improved.
bhuvnesh mahajan : zen mode is excellent, with no game score , game over and relaxing music & mountainous scenery , it's a good game to relax after giving exams, ...etc.
juliet lyall : brilliant game. could do with a little more to it though, such as a way to unlock alternative outfits or upgrade abilities, otherwise once you've completed all objectives it ceases to be fun.
suraj narang : iam speechless... really, it feels so good when you are playing it alongwith the music (turning on dolby atmos)... game has been crafted beautifully, and it doesnt takes too much time to progress further into the game... thanks to the team of dev for such a wonderful creation...
chris geer : this game is so damn immersive that when i play late at night and the game decides it's time for a thunder storm, i think a flash storm is hitting...probably because i am really tired, anyway great game would recommend to anyone who wants a game that will suck you into a private universe for a bit!!
chris viljoen : this is the most beautiful and calming game you can possibly download. great for if you just want to kill some time. simply put.... you have to try it before you'll realise just how perfect this game really is.
sydney moore : from amazing graphics, admirable characters and splendid music i can see why there is so much praise.
mark alexandre : the games looks amazing from the menu screen to gameplay. objectives and characters keep the game feeling fresh and makes you come back. i don't see any flaw in this game at all. they don't even force ads on you! good job noodle cake.
slot one : great game to just play. tutorial is well explained and this game gives a good difficulty for you. zen mode is really good to play to learn the game and it's all around fun. 5 stars.
adarsh ishwar hegde : this game is truly a work of art. i am enjoying every feel and aspect put into making this, the feel of the environment and the mesmerising art is truly great.
aaron binder : easily the most beautiful and elegant side scroller i've ever played. scales well level wise and rarely feels too easy or difficult.
cynthia read : a very peaceful yet fun game. another reviewer called it non-toxic; i might go so far as to say detoxifying (to the extent that anything on an electronic device could be so).
daniel naron : excellent gameplay and with the inspiring music, just makes it a lot more closer to perfection wishing that the music was downloadable so i can carry it anywhere.
theunluckyvj : loved everything in the game .. the sound effects especially and the fact that the time changes .. it's superb i enjoy it thoroughly
a google user : it's an amazing game. the graphics, the detail with which the day and night are depicted the music.the effort by the developers is praiseworthy. the levels are tricky but do able, leaves you to come back and back again,keeps you hooked. great game thank you
shishir kumar banerjee : awesome game guyz, a must have game. zen mode in the game is the best one, just put on the head phones or plug in to home theatre system and then just get lost in the music, sound effects and all.. thanks dev team..
jason john : if i had a morphine drip i think i'd pull it out after playing this... such a simple game but very deep and eclectic at the same time
sarthak sharma : game is too good and relaxing. but were is the option to choose snow boards. make more challenges. make more obstacles. more animals. and make good than ever before. otherwise the game is awesome.
harrison mayfield : totally beautiful landscapes. simple to pick up and play. challenging without being frustrating. a pure joy to play for minutes or for hours
conor : i had the fortune of my cousin introducing me to this game, about 5 months ago. since then i've played it every day and have even recently reset stats (after reaching level 60) to enjoy the game again. thanks!
vincent ramaglia : this game is beautiful in both the graphics and music. it reminds of journey and yet now here i feel like we have a mobile version. this game is stunning.
ella passey : it's a challenge but also can be relaxing. i never get tired of playing it.
vikram das : truly a work of art. never seen a game before with such aesthetic value. music could not have been better. keep up the good work guys.
rashaad reid : this game is amazing. the only change i would suggest is to show your best distance somewhere. i would like to know my best.
james o'keeffe : this game is the perfect stress reliever. relaxing music, pretty, calm visuals, challenging but not frustrating. no aggressive ads or even strong pushes for their in-app purchases. once i've beaten this, i may just buy something from the store to support the devs.
mikey awbrey : this game is what every other "free" game wishes it was. no begging, no ads unless you want a little boost, and no pushing micro transactions down your throat after every run. not to mention it is also a solidly fun game.
ascotchegg : 1 tap games usually aren't very fun or graphically inspiring. however alto's adventure is beautiful and fun it has an art style which is unique but comfortable
milan shalimon : this never ending running game is the best running game i have ever seen. it offers a good graphics and a magnificent background music. and its never boring until ur phone battery is down to low.
mladen petronijevic : simple and relaxing game, clean and beautiful graphics that reflect satisfaction and peace of mind combined with the music that follows the same feeling. this game is perfect for those short pauses during the work day to help you fly away. i really enjoy it.
halimah akhtar : i have been searching all over the place for a game that i can call mine, a game i really love, for over 3 months, and i have finally found it. this game is relaxing and makes me feel like i really am the character. i love how you can skii forever with zen mode for free! this is my game and always will be.
debasish sarkar : just great time killer, just more tracks would be awesome. the sound in this game is just beautiful and pleasant to there ears. hope more of such would follow
a google user : it is the best ever game i played in my life. i have best experience for this game. even i never ever rated any other game. seriously you should play this game with full volume.
ronit sadhukhan : the sound of the nature, the music and the scenes are awesome. i get lost into it whenever i play.
ash : really polished and smooth to play, still don't see the point of catching llamas is though. either way amazing game
satyaranjan panigrahi : why dont you update some new things in it. i like this game but now a days its being bore for me.plzz add some updates some new thing to it. thanks.
adatrum : it's really cool so calm perfect game you can not bored by planning it do a long time really good
mani honey : loved to play and its live one feeling relaxed playing this... u hav done ultimate job thnq u so much for the game
reuben : i haven't played games on my phone in ages because i was bored of them, but then i found alto and i'm addicted. very fun with good challenges and easy game play while still being exciting. you aren't forced to watch ads, and you could let your kids play too. my favorite game. a few little glitches like needing to tap the screen twice on menu options, etc, but harmless.
fraser lovie : love this app, takes practice but you learn as you play more, calming music and setting especially at dusk, love zen mode too
gabriel centino : please notice me game creator!!!!! its a very good game actually but. i think you should add physics to the characters, just like how you add physics to the scarf ( when character goes up, backflips, lands,etc.) but not to the point where it looks like a ragdoll, a little arms raising maybe? head movement when landing. 2nd. available tricks will be nicer. like unlockables. front flip. 360 turn, hand stand. those stuff. and like for that you get to cjabge the controls like swiping up or holding the screen. 3.) costumes!!! we would not love custumized costumes? and boards 4.) more scenery, simple like fireworks. or a fall season. well, it could be external files or whatver, the seasons in the game is in a loop, maybe add some different house, or maybe new things 5.) something more to an elder chase. maybe chasing a giant llama? that would be cool. or an avalanche escape! 6.) since its called adventure. maybe a story line would be nice? like conversations, mystery, mission, a good storyline. save someone. 7.) what happens after an the last character? 8.) new set song or customized songs well, been playing this for almost 2 years so yeah i hope you consider some of my suggestions!:)) thank you!
kyle zk : doesn't want me to rate all the time, no pop up adds, very addicting and challenging. my only issue is, is that paz can go so fast that he goes right through coins and power ups.
a google user : terrific music score. the game play is intuitive and draws you in. the zenith mode is perfect. 5 stars for this was an easy decision
bivek sharma : this game is best designed for fun relaxation no hurry laidback with awesome music, zen mode simply superb. keep it up guys waiting for more fun and new things in game
nate saunders : i've spent hours playing this game. zen mode is very relaxing. pause button is a bit unresponsive under my big fat fingers. love it.

tony gutierrez : background music is calm and serene, with atmospheric sound effects that immerse you in the game's snowy mountains.
tanish adarkar : its sooo beautiful and calming. the art style is amazing. best music ever hands down best mobile experience ever . u wil regret not playing this
sabyasachi dasgupta : thank you so so much for this wonderful game... the zen mode is the only thing that makes me feel better on low days... please make it more aesthetic if possible.
kevin r. l. : this game is absolutely gorgeous, it has great graphics, great art style , great music, i just love it. i also love zen mode it is so relaxing i love the sound of the rain and the music. i love this game. and keep up the great work.
anthony godde : smooth designs fluid controls and by far one of the most addicting games i've ever played. only thing i could recommend is adding some new characters.
shobhit : this is the best game i have ever played . its simple . the zen mode is the best.just a endless run .whenever i feel depressed i play this game especially the zen mode and then realte it to my life and then stand up again with a sense of winning. love ythis game !!
sid hicks : absolutely love to play this game on my freetime, great way to sit back, relax and have fun. i hope to see this game have new things added overtime, and expand its horizons!
rammay : i play this game since something like an year and i still like it. it relaxes me a lot, i especially like the zen mode. i just have a problem with the google play access: i did it and i completed the game, but uninstalled it and then had no savings, god i felt so bad about it
raian levy : great game overall. relaxing music, simple graphics and smooth and straightforward gameplay. spent multiple hours on zen mode btw
jj theredking : im not to keen on the normal mode but i absolutely love zen mode, its so calm and you can just relax. the art style is amazing and the music fits so well with the game. brilliant!
joshua zamrycki : fun and addictive game with simple yet challenging mechanics. it took long enough to complete that i really felt satisfied when i made it to the end.
indranil majumder : extremely well made with visually pleasing graphics. you are bound to get lost in the beautiful gamely along with the serene music. one of the best games.
alexander warfare : the game started with a simple task: retrieve your lamas that are galloping down the mountain. after awhile, i started taking wild lamas that were just running down the slopes. but even that wasn't enough for me. my village friends had lamas! i wanted them all! i took their lamas while ruthlessly doing backflips and tearing down their flags for no reason other than i thought i looked cool doing it! after that i distupted sleeping elderly folks! sadly, my fun came to an end when i backflipped down a cliff.
azhan naseer : loved it a lot. very cool concept. and the idea of having levels on the same place is just very unique.had a lot of fun. recommend it to everyone
aejaz ansari : its a great game. i loved its simple and smooth graphic with melodious music and beautiful days and nights
lina butler : i love this game so much. i don't get hooked on stuff but i'm definitely hooked on this game! it's a bit funny and creepy to see elder or llama jump off the cliff. not sure if it's a glitch or is it supposed to be like that...
dalton crew : this game for the simplicity of it is absolutely fantastic. i personally love games that are easy to use, beautifully made and well thought out as well as the music. 10/10 developers keep it up
rishahd sims : there needs to be more maps and characters for this game, and outfit changes/upgrades ect. other than that it is outstanding!
kilikk : i love this game. i think zen mode will more enjoy with selected soundtrack from player, so they can choose the soundtrack for zen mode
hassan rafique : you can't imagine how addicting and enjoyable game it is. the graphics are really catchy :)
oscar mouland_ley : it's the best game i've played in years because all other games are just too complicated and are hard to follow
gavin b : this is a great little game, it's simple and slick. not many games have been produced to this quality level.
clinton presiloski : seriously, with 'zen mode' you just get lost in this game. an hour will fly by and you're still contentedly gliding down the (world's highest, hahaha) slopes. quite possibly the most satisfying app out there!
t bruh : this game not only is incredibly artistic and stylized, but the atmosphere and sound design us superb. this makes alto's adventure a marvel of an experience; a relaxing and beautiful interactive piece of art :)
james paolo menguito : alto is really addicting. i started out seldom playing it but once i got really bored and progressed, i started playing it every chance i got. it does not try to overfulfill itself and retains it simplistic yet fun gameplay. i dont usually do reviews and ratings but alto needs it!
rory haresnape : you can get everything in the game free. you genuinely don't have to spend a dime because you can get insane amounts of coins through watching ads. i love these developers please support them.
ashish : amazing! i installed this game yesterday, the scenery and graphics quality along with the music is pretty nice. however, it's difficult to see objects in night, and controls can be better too.
erum durrani : i live in a hot region. i have never seen snow or snowfall. this game showed me the awesomeness of a sport i have never experienced!
deltanemesis : simple concept combined with breath taking artwork, alto's adventure is a beauty. competive, yet relaxing. the obstacles feels natural and everything in the game add something, visually or the other, to the incredible scenery. excellent work devs!!
jatin bajpai : it's more than just a game it's an experience. i have never ever felt so overwhelmed thank you a ton. the graphics, the background song everything is more than just excellence. thank you again.
matthew rowe : i really appreciate this game, for the many hours of relaxation, wonder, and excitement. there are not many games where i am so compelled to keep going forward, that i am not simply doing it to unlock the next character, but to simply snowboard down a mountain catching sweet air and glorious views. thank you
blu ranger : beautiful landscapes, amazing characters i could go on forever! no wonder this is one of the best 2016 game and editors choice. lovely music very relaxing and amazing game play. i have nothing bad to say...

francisco melendez : i dont get hitched on a single game ever, but this game is so great it's my go-to game when i have time to kill. i love the graphics, the music. i especially love the zen mode. this game is so relaxing and enteetaining
bassed : very simple game with not a lot of content. but its relaxing and nice to play every now and then when you are waiting for something. could use more variation of bgm though.
kinaav areacode : great,nice music,good graphics but one bug noticed. some times the touch screen freezes about 5 to 10 seconds while playing the game. please fix this bug and add armv8 to next update.
kate 049 : i really like the relaxing mode when you slide to the right on home. it's so stress calm and there is nothing but you and the mountains. also the game itself is amazing. i really recommend it.

drew blade : the ambient and mood it gives out is perfect, the design is perfect and the game mechanism is perfect. i cant get enough of this game. the zen mode is really something different and the missions you get while playing are great. highly recommended!
karandeep singh : just fell in love with the music and every background landscape actions as well .. its really a beautiful game
kind pimp : the gameplay is simple and addictive. what stands out are the aesthetics and soundtrack. easily the best free game you can get.
tobias kunz : one of the best mobile games i have ever played. the atmosphere, the design, its so simple, but so amazing. one criticism thats vital! add in the ability to frontflip as well as backflip. because, if you accidentally backflip a little bit, theres no way of rectifying it, so you are doomed to lose. just one fix, but a brilliant game. very, very well done.
a google user : both visuals and bgm are amazing. honestly. kudos especially to the guy who composed the music. now i feel like living on a mountainside
c m : that's the word first time i said while playing the game. i never said wow for any game i played in yrs. i was just lost in the music the mountains. the snow what can i say . its just relaxing awesome game.
endcryonix music : this is one of the best games on android. the controls are simple which makes it perfect for a mobile game. the graphics are minimalist but also beautiful. although it could be better if there are more modes.
amit bl : i have been a fan of stickman golf. i'm in immense bliss after playing this game. never thought a game could be so soothening and enticing. kudos to noodlecake studios..
bigpaul : love this game totally worth it u will play this for hours.... please make new challenges

andre candido : one of the best mobile games i've ever played. the simple graphics, the smooth gameplay, the map. the only problem is that i could use a timer on the final score and there isn't one.
living_dead_girl : this game is so cool if u want to see some beautiful sentry play this game . i've got to maya.
j.r. duren : great game. plenty of characters but only two are useful. reaching the final level is anti-climactic.

adam gardner : this is such a well designed game. the physics, visuals and most of all the music are fine tuned to perfection. have already lost hours on this. big congrats to the developers on this one!
jaren rivera : the music is amazing, the graphic style is the best i've ever seen for a mobile game! i could litterally play this over and over again, and for some reason it's always interesting.
cali exodus : this game has those kinds of graphics that make it look beautiful and everything in it also makes it awesome. imma do this again... snowboard down a mountain
nala sselwal : it all about sselwall guy,a average. guy he started fighting for mankind, i belong to god as we are look at a dog, even. a ant
nino sie : love the simple graphic and the soothing music! btw when you're in zen mode, you fell into the cliff then you tap to restart, it freezed. please fix it, thanks.
andres herrera : it would make more sense if the ramp kicker would continue trick combos since it can start them, and similarly it would be nice if ice slides could start and continue trick combos. also i noticed that if you land on the edge of the ramp the animation glitches and makes you land immediately but it's a really small issue since it doesn't cause me to fall off the board. other than that, i can't find a single flaw with this game. brilliantly designed, all the hard work that was put into it really shows
jamie walker : amazing game i love it i played for 30days strait no lie it's so amazing i swear it's the top game in the united states of america sooooooooooo buititful and great game #i love it
julian : i love everything about this game. its relaxing , perfect sounds and gameplay is very enjoyable . everything is also very polished. i like that in a game thank you.

paul alfaro : such a beautiful game overall, even when you crash if you look to the background it will almost always be pretty and amazing, if only i could find more games like this that were fun.
jerwin czr : i lost the feeling of being in a moment and i have never thought games will make me feel alive and happy. i recommend this playing with headset and in zen mode. i have never played a game like this before.
baked panda : there are very few games with which i'm obsessed with. this is one of them. i recommend you to download it. the gameplay is beautiful, phenomenal music and the whole experience is one that everybody will enjoy.
joshua howard : i am not usually into mobile games, but this one is my favorite, one that i will keep playing. it is really relaxing with the simple yet amazing visuals, simple gameplay, and great soundtrack. this is endless but the challenges provide, well, a good challenge, and goals.
jiya jiji : this game is just so beautiful i can't deceribe how amazing the animation is. just click that install button and see it 4 yourself if u haven't installed it yet.
kumar akarsh : this game is very heart touching because when i played its zen mode by wearing my headphones i thought i was apart if that moment when i was playing..and it's sceneries, music and the other things are awsome.........i love it
zengkoy : i love this game, the music, the soud fx, the gameplay. i have a suggestion, when you bought the wingsuit, you should have unlimited wingsuit in zen mode. and make the character a ragdoll when he crashed so he will roll downhill.
a freeman : best game of this type that i've played. great graphics, style, characters, and uniqueness. one problem i had was during night time, i find it very difficult to see obstacles with low brightness and i didn't want to have to increase my brightness just to see obstacles. also, when you revive in front of a chasm, you don't have enough speed to make it across so it's another automatic death after spending 1,500 coins. :)
the dustroyer : one of the best games for android, in my opinion. it could use some customizable character options or like character upgrades. stuff like that. otherwise still amazing.
karanvir singh : i love to play this game whenever i'm stressed or depressed. it's a great stress reliever.
alka sharma : more than a game it's a life story of a person who is doing so much sacrifices loved it try it plz
paul istoan : great game! but you should fix the "video not available" popup. that shouldn't appear while you are playing. also, sometimes after you watch a video, when it gets back in the game, nothing works anymore. you touch the screen and the game is not responding.
jacob harris : one thing though, i think that after you have completed all the goals there should be a prize like a character with twice the speed or jump.
mart w : i don't play many mobile games yet i have wasted away hour of my life on this game. just love it.
gunner verne : this game is pretty sick because u get 2 go on a. . . adventure. so i gunner will provide my talent to this beautiful game.
youssef hossam : i really love this game.. the zen mode is just gorgeous i was about to cry
abishek chandrabose : this is the closest any app can come to relieve a person from stress. zen mode was excellent and graphics add to the beauty of the game.
chace campbell : i didn't get this game for the longest time simply because, based off of the app icon, i thought it was just another 2d snowboarding game. i was so wrong. it's an amazing game and now one of my all time favorite mobile games!
a google user : i really love the game and the music and the art style (basically everything) and i'm really glad i downloaded it! i have one suggestion, though. could you make a level difficulty thing that players can select? i am kind of scared of the guy that chases you when you get to a certain point in the game and it really stresses me out (it's not funny!) i would really appreciate it!
amir sharara : one of the rare apps that got me hooked. chellenging goals and fun ones. i just finished all the 61 level :)
c sd : it's easy to play and challenging and fun all at the same time. it's also really pretty. i love it! but it's become a bit buggy recently...after i 'revive' a character a few times the screen starts sort of shaking and it slows down, so i can't play properly. please fix the bug!
dark moon : this game makes me yearn to nature, such a great experience, relaxing after a long hard day, very special and wonderful music, quality and graphic ...
tziona albrecht : brilliant game. artistry is beautiful and the music is entrancing. having to ctach llamas is both entertaining and amusing. though the elders are very hard to escape from, it's still a fantastic game.
shashi srivastava : altos adventure is paid on ios but i was so happy that it is free on android . thank you very much to the devlopers
max r : my favorite game, both soothing and challenging. beautiful, but not quite easy. really pleasant experience.

saurabh shukul : the pixel graphics are gorgeous and the day night cycle transitons in 2d pixel art are really innovative and breathtaking. gameplay is relaxing but gets a little repetitive imo, but still worth 5 stars.
scott spinks : this game is a wonder to play. the challenges allow for a sense of progression, while also supplying a relaxing playing experience. easily my favourite mobile game.

gumilang suraduhita : great graphics, beautiful background, music and minimalistic art style so when you play it there will always be this constant calming vibe, for the 2d sort of runner game that this is, they didn't really have a lot to worry about so the whole mechanic and the basic controls of this game isn't something to be worried about too much which again gives that calming feeling and immersion of some sort.

marked zenuasia : its quite an interesting game despite it being a snowboarding game where you think you have to focus while on the slopes but somehow im distracted by the shocking warm soothing, laid back and relaxing music and the clear soft focused pastel colored graphics that got my jaw a-jar, this is as oppose to usual fast punk rock music and visuals of rad mayhem that i was expecting?!..and owh yes, i dunno wether its just me or what but the music, isnt it tom day!!?? bcuz it is so fitting man! good job! thanks!

jason ekonomakos : aesthetically pleasing, fun and has some depth. such a well made game i
still remember it years later
aknomics : simplistic, calming game only suggestion to developer is that the things that are needed to be done to level up should be recorded by the game irrespective of the level i'm on. for example, if i'm on level 2 and i complete all the requirements of level 5, then automatically level 2,3 and 4 should be skipped..

joey : if you like endless runners and achievement based gameplay this is the game for you. this everything a mobile game should be. the controls are super simple and intuitive and it flows so gracefully you can't help but play again and again. the real genius of this game is teaching all of its secrets slowly. granting you different characters that require different play styles so that you get good at every aspect.

bachris official : this game is so good and it made me a little emotional because the music reminds me of some bad times in a very good way though
nate the great : this game is sooo awesome!! i absolutely love the fact that in the last update they added zen mode which is so relaxing. i think noodlecake studios inc should make another game exaclty like this but with a horse rider instead of a snowborader. and you should take the idea from this game of zen mode and put it in the new game that i hope noodlecake studios inc will create.

han park : hard controlling
gelo ruanto : this is called simplicity
paul murphy : high
m i : gotta try it
alfred mutua : the game
bobby o'leary : very bueno
noah austin jayson : i hearted it
diptesh bose : sothing!!!
mounir abdou : omg incradible
prashant yadav : looking for this
charis tam : it's really hard to find a game like this. the scenery is breathtaking as well as the calm music. zen mode has also allowed to to relieve stress. although this isn't one of those exciting games, alto's adventure isn't something i'd want to miss. the best part is that there are no ads.
james kay : love this game. one of my all time favourites on android. the design is gorgeous and the game easy to pick up, but the challenges at each level mean it doesn't lose its appeal after repeated plays. i also like how in game purchases aren't thrust in your face like in other games. overall, highly recommend
sarah nasrullah : this game is honestly one of the most stunning things i have ever seen and i am so happy it exists. thank you to all the wonderful humans who made this, may you all go to heaven and drink rivers of yummy wine and maple syrup :d.
a google user : i've enjoyed alto's adventures since many months now and i've finished it long ago. to enjoy the challenges again, i reset the progress. but upon doing so, it asked me to repeat the reset process across devices connected to icloud. i remember downloading this from the google play store ;) but a world class game in every way.
astrad the cynic : the game ran beautifully until the last update. the game has started to lagging, ads are no longer available, and the frame rate is dropping to the point where it makes me dizzy. my phone has a snapdragon 810 with 4gb of ram, there's no excuse for lag or low frame rates.
vulpes vulpes : you can tell immediately that this game has been made with the most passionate intentions. it is beautifully presented and thought out. the landscape, the weather, the music, the flow of the game. not another generic attempt to get your money or bombard you with advertising...this is a game that has been created by someone who wanted to make a beautiful game, and they've succeeded. download it :-)
spaghetti cat : the scenery is absolutely breathtaking, especially on the chasm jumps which slow down time just enough to show your character soaring through a masterfully crafted sky. the shader-like effects are tasteful, not overdone. the ads are noninvasive. overall, this is among the most well designed games i've ever played. great job. i really enjoy this game.
mark ruggles : i can count on one hand the number of reviews that i've ever written for an app and i don't think any of them were for a game. however, this game, this game begs a review. the game is visually stunning. the physics are graceful, beautiful, and right. zen mode, enough said. my only wish would be for more tricks besides the back flip. this is the only thing i would change about this game. thank you, thank you for keeping it ad free! incredible!
a google user : this game is awesome. it's a great time waster, and you don't have to worry about dying or failing all the time thanks to the zen mode. it's well-organized and i love the animation. the concept is really cool too. i love that you're chasing your escaped llamas. flips and tricks are easy, and i love the fact that the scarf elongates every time you get a boost or land a flip. all in all, this is an amazing game! one flaw though. i can't figure out what a hover feather is, so i can't complete one of my goals.
kshiteej : from the moment i saw zen mode, i just started screenshoting each jump, cliff, sun/moon rise/set, this game just brings a wide smile on my face, i don't know why. this game will be in my most memorable and favourable moblie games of my life list. and it be first on it! i can't describe it in words. you must play this game and you find that you are so i don't know, found peace in busy life? the normal mode will be good,but zen is the best! i really can't describe this game in words.seriously. play this game.
the excruciator : it's a great game for procrastinating but i got so addicted to it that i pretty much play this game all day. this mobile game is better than many pc/console games. it is also not very challenging, which is a break from all the other games where you die every 10 seconds. don't get me wrong: i like challenging games, but i get to relax a bit with this game.
0v3rl0rd : just a great game overall. really fun and soothing at times and the gameplay is just so smooth. the goals are challenging, but not too much and the different characters are all pretty cool and unique. one of the best games i have ever played, highly recommend this game!
dhruov bhatia : the mechanics are simple and the characters are reasonably diverse. gameplay is smooth and consistent; no frame rate or performance issues and the physics work fine. the soundtrack is good albeit simple and matches the atmosphere. there are no heavy, incessant microtransactions involved and it is not p2w. overall an excellent game. also, for everyone below saying you have to watch a video to continue, that is just bs. end your turn and play again. you don't have to pay 1500 coins every time you fall.
aliyah jubilee : i downloaded this game thinking "oh its gonna be one of those stupid games" but no its really fun and easy once you get the hang of it. i haven't found a game quite like this one.the graphics are great and the game is really smooth to play. no bugs yet.
sayyid hakam : this game is really simple, you only need one thumb to play it, but it's really fun. with maya as player you can perform many tricks combo and it's so lovely to see it. also the scene background is beautiful thought it's only 2d. the relaxing music add up the beauty of this game. the only problem for me is when it comes to night; it's too dark my eyes feel uncomfortable, and it becomes annoying when you can't see the rock and then you just fall because of the silly rock. anyway, it's enjoyable
karla bergado : this game is by far my favourite at the moment! the graphics are really great. 2d yet simple but sophisticated. the soundtrack is so peaceful and calming especially during zen mode. it's great to play on zen if you're stressed and you're just finding a short while to relax. the overall game is cheerful and fun, with the mini challenges and the llamas. this game is highly recommendable to everyone!
naman arusia : yes. you've heard it all. you've seen it before. journey, flowers, shadow of colossus. but even after you have, this game will make you wonder, it's a lot more than meets the eyes. "zen mode" is somewhat of a unique take on the infinite runner approach. and that is what makes this an exhilarating experience. yes this is a beautiful package of "drown yourself into the atmospheric musical score" & "loose yourself into the easing visual fidelity", but the creator have something more than the sum of it's parts.
john sedrak : this is hands down the most beautiful game i've ever played. the atmosphere is perfect and the rain makes it even better. its great for those days where you just wanna play something casual and calming while thinking about whatever's been on your mind lately
chris ng : alto's adventure is truly a piece of art. from the artwork-like graphics to the impeccable sound design, alto's adventure might be one of our best free games we have left. both modes have a soundtrack that fits their purpose, and sound effects bring you up to the mountain regions. the simple yet breathtaking physics helps the simulation of snowboarding. and if the soundtrack doesn't work for you, playing your playlist in place of the game's own music also feels right.
benjamin biddle : hey guys love the game. it plays really well but i feel like it need a few tweaks when it comes to second chances and also double and triple backflips. firstly i think when you take damage and you try again you should have a second of invincibility because ive had moments when i would respawn and hit a rock without the slightest chance of avoiding it. think of it like the way sonic takes damage when u get a slight chance to grab coins before you actually die. also i think that when you do a double or triple
natalie patalie : i came back to this game years later after its initial release. i am glad
to declare that alto's adventure is the single best free-to-play mobile
game to have ever existed. thank you team alto for this gorgeous
masterpiece, may you make many, many more.
ahmed tharwat : but it can be in the update that you add some adjustments in the music .. for these peoples , such as "alexandro querevalu" so do not be one of music in order to enjoy the game more and i hope that...thank you for this game
rice ! 2.0 : this game has an amazing art design, i just got it yesterday and haven't stopped playing since
sage the prestigious : this is a wonderful game! the characters each have different abilities and techniques and the scenery is gorgeous! the game is so great, i'm surprised as i am impressed that there isn't an ad popping up every second! not only that, you can earn everything you need with work instead of money. the only problem i have is when i do a really amazing jump, and i can't see a warning sign, i fall right into a chasm. it hardly takes away from the game (and you probably can't fix that). otherwise, great!
rabia akram : to be very frank, i have mistakenly installed this game but the experience so far took me to the new level of infinite happiness.actually the tagline was very alluring. a sleepy mountain village.or what else you want?just one more llama.just one more trick to play. back flips? wingsuits?got coins?better use them wisely.else don't use at all.this game will mock you, jolt you and at the same time beautifully lash upon you to respect your elders. and the zen mode is brilliancy in making the music stand out.
christopher john munar : the game had a very wonderfull graphics paired with awesome gamplay with the help of relaxing music.. can't let off the game until you are forced to close the game due to chores need to accomplish at home.. very wonderful game must try to prove that this game kicked other leading games!!! warning!! do your chores first at home to avoid being scolded by your parents
gabrielle kansay : it's really just what anyone needs to escape the typically cliche race games. good way to kill time while working on something.
cristian perez : playing this app is relaxing, with the music and the light sounds of nature. with earphones they sound so realistic, especially during a thunderstorm.
sam lines : this game was so refreshing and new, i loved every second of it and i hope the creature's make another game just as good as this one.
nick jones : words can't describe how lovely this game is.. so chilling and the zen mode sums it all up
naresh d : no words to describe it's passion in beauty in evary frame.i can feel
relief & totally a peaceful game.must playable game for nature lovers.
mark wilson : so simple yet so addictive. the randomization of the course each time through keeps you on your toes and keeps the game interesting.
a google user : soothing and fun. just lost myself in it. developers should get a big hug. no pressure to buy with real cash too. no bugs. extraordinary!
zong hua : concept of the game is extremely simple to understand and gives a full tutorial beforehand. what amazes me is the amazing graphics, especially how it simulates day and night, the different weathers like raining! they even added a zen mode just for you to enjoy the game without worrying about "dying" in the game!
erica iraheta : the art style is amazing, its story is cute, the music and sound effects are beautiful and realistic. a++
amir firdaus : it's a simple game that everyone could've done. but not everyone can make it as enjoyable as this. the scenery is so beautiful, it just speaks for itself. combining that with the calm music, amazing. gives me a peace of mind. this is good for mind therapy. absolutely loved it! kudos to the devs!
james woods : great graphics very fun and challenging game. wish there were more levels. beaten the game twice. that's the only thing i would change with it.
balance luck : and then zen mode came out. i could finally play with my favorite character again, the spinny girl, even though her momentum isnt the best. the music is great, i love altos adventure!
yanelis melendez : probably one of the best games i've gotten in a long long time. i adore the visuals, music, characters, and fun objectives. the zen mode is outstanding; it really does help me relax. i could play this game for hours.
elizabeth batrez : the animation is so beautiful! you see the sun and moon rise, and it rains!! the transcending from light to dark and vice versa is gorgeous. the game itself is challenging, but nothing crazy. the music really adds this feeling of calmness and peacefulness. plus, if this isn't enough, the llamas are so cute!! also, the game runs really smoothly, and is pleasing to the eye.
hammersmashedtaco : there's not really anything i can bad mouth about this game, everything it's as it should be, an amazing endess runner game with various environments, weather and obstacle combo's.
tayl0rd 06 : i'm blown away by how this game looks, it's unlike any other game i have seen for mobile devices. it's worth the download even just to look at, and that's before i even mention the stunning gameplay. seriously, the design team has a lot to be proud of, they've created a work of art. the sunrise sequences, are you kidding me?? gorgeous, 5 stars
pati burn : love it. i especially enjoy zen mode. just put on my headphone and play while listening to amazingly calming music.
manoj singh : one of the best mobil game i have played and every time it keeps supering me with different level changes.
vaibhav khisti : ohhh, the zen mode i don't usually do reviews. but yes, much much appreciated. soothing n smartly done. good job ppl. looking fwd to enhancements.
gibryon bhojraj : the game is amazing and relaxing. i just found zen mode, the icing to get me over here to review it.
usman ahmed : it's both challenging and relaxing, depends how you play. no ads whatsoever, only if you chose to watch them.
afnan plays : this game has an absolutely beautiful graphics, and runs smoothly. i could play this all day long.
eric s : the graphics are gorgeous but very simple,each character has its own play style i downloaded this game my 3rd time so i can play thou it again.the music is its own thing...its so relaxing,nice,and suits the game perfectly.if i could give the game more than 5 stars i would.
crystal suen : fun and really calms me. it's a challenge but not impossible, and very little learning curve. it definitely kills time and keeps me wanting more to get more achievements.
edward coker : if you love to sit down and stare at your phone and play a fun time wasting game then install this because if you are on the bus or train or at an awkward event then this is the best way to block the world out and just loose yourself in the great music and art style of the game. if you use headphones then you will end up stopping playing just to listen to the amazing soundtrack, it is difficult and yet it is not a game that makes you want to rage quit it just makes you want to play more.
alisher shaiken : dear development team, the game is great and thanks for the good work. it seems that if when playing izel and smashing into the rock (falling) and consequently the finishing jump takes you into chasm the game never takes you back to the menu.
sumit naiya : most unique game i've ever seen. the music is background which keep me in relaxing mood & snowboarding is really adventurous
hannah wosu : great graphics relaxing peaceful. if youre one of those peaceful quiet gamers this is for you. its so mystical and beautiful. i love it addicting. i have it on my xbox and my lg tablet.
mustafa hashem : the graphics the environment the music is so beautiful i wish there is more than five stars to give, thank you
t f : looks like it was inspired by journey. gorgeous and fun. i just wish they'd add skip-ads item in the shop. (i really hate having to look at other ugly games)
justin richards : awesome. has kept me playing for several weeks, but now the goals are all complete, the fun goes :(
a s k : the graphics are amazing, simple yet eye catching and the game keeps you coming back.
bryan suandoko : i love the art, design and the music of course. i just hoping noodlecake would share the music as mp3.. it will be good..
anna lewis : a lovely game, very relaxing (apart from when you wake an elder), i really like the music and the changing light is excellent. i like snowboarding in night best.
ahmad alshami : i have been playing it for a couple of months... really hope there were more challenges
luiz valerio neto : just another beautiful piece of art. and not only with great graphics and sound effects / tracks but with great balanced challenges too. definitely recommend.
abdul-quddus : this is an amazing peaceful fun game it's so addictive and i'm telling all my family and friends about it
the great bergamo : this game is amazing. reminds me of ssx because of how chill and relaxing the game can be. even when i have goals i'm still just relaxes and flipping through the sky.
thevilesaint : a beautifully made skill game that can keep you occupied for longer than you might initially anticipate. the art style is phenomenon, the play is smooth, and perhaps the best part, no forced ads! brilliant game.
lenny : i love it because the look of the game is very much like my style of drawing. also it's so calming it's great for if ure having a bad day because u can put it in zen mode and just play.
desislav lesov : i've owned my nvidia shield for a good while now and there has not been a game on it that i've enjoyed more than this. highly recommended!
fachrizal reza adriansyah : the gameplay is simple, but lovely. also the graphic are stunning. its so comfy in the eyes. and most important, its adfree.

rupak saha : it's like a dream land.specially zen mode music & weather changes
joe greer : this is probably one of the best games i've ever played in this genre. i found myself playing it in a hospital waiting room and i haven't stopped since.
eclecticone : this game is a great way to unwind. the zen-like music combined with the smooth game play and minimalist game interface make it a true pleasure. it's a keeper.
jaydip chanda : i is a great game to me. it's character, weather changes, back flips so cool. everybody should try this. awesome.
logan p : this game is absolutely stunning, it has beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay, and is extremely relaxing. this is the best game you can download, and to top it all off, it's free!

pawan h : it adds much more to aesthetics of gaming via freeplay filled with endless mountains. thank you noodlecake for thoughtfully developing this game.one of the best.
jonathan matignas : lovely visuals with beautiful music. this game can be challenging but it's main draw for me it's wonderful soundtrack.
nithin s : the music & the gameplay makes us involve to the game. pls share me the bgm sounds of alto's adventure if anyone have. the app need to improve in taking screenshot that it storing only one by replacing the older one.
tuga gamer : light and beautiful graphics, no lag, nice gameplay and splendid soundtrack, it's safe to say it's among the best mobile games
matei mihail : this is one of the best indie games i've ever played. very relaxing and i like that they added zen mode. nice graphics and gameplay. it deserves more than 5 stars :d
matthew koen : this game is by far the most relaxing and exiting game i have ever played, no doubt. the zen mode can put you in such a state of calmness and happiness at the same time. get this game! you wont regret it
ayan alam : once i played i felt it's four star but then i wanted to play more and more best game ever made
colin : you realy are missing out if you dont play this, amazing game, zen mode is great too. must have game.

sequoyah h. : this game is one of the best games i have ever played and i would recommend it to all of my friends and you!
nathan tj : i have a suggestion. i think it would be really cool if you added some sort of race mode to race down the hill (computers and/or online multiplayer). thank you for reading.
robin rahman : the games incredible, but my only problem is when rocks appear when going steeply downhill... im moving way too fast to react to that

rio s : one of the best games i've had the pleasure to play. normally i get bored with mobile games after sometime, but not this. it's really good.
ahmad abdallah : absolutely stunning, but i think that the empowers should appear more often and ramps easier to jump. i always lose because of the very difficult to jump ramps
teresa marin : alto's adventure is an awesome game from it's precise controls(alto's backflip is like sonic homing attack with a twist), minimalistic art style, epic music, endless mountains, challenging missions(wich are skipable), even things like the day-night cycle and power-ups are awesome, and zen mode is so relaxing, add to that varied obstacles and hundreds of tricks and that's one of the best mobile games out there!
gavin clark : great time killer, addicting, simple, no need for in-app purchases. the only thing for me is that sometimes a button might not work but, eh, i have a crappy phone.
george daly : this game is extremely well made. normal mode is a fun way to spend your time and zen mode is a brilliant idea added to an already great game which helps u improve and practice without worrying about playing well.
visenya ackerman : playing this game in zen mode with headphones on is so soothing such relaxing music and amazing graphics. beautiful concept.
alberto rodriguez : fantastic game & a stress reliever. zen mode update has excellent, relaxing compositions. other than that, the game is very enjoyable and beautifully made in a minimal asthetic.
rowan oak : great time killer, fun in general. does anyone know what the music in zen mode is called, i want to download it

jakob crawford : stunning game. zen mode is a great addition for those who just want to tune out and enjoy the game.
vivek patwardhan : who want 3d graphics crunching games on phone. this game delivers best 2.5d experience. just tap tap and tap. lesser controls to play and more adventure. 5 stars are obvious. btw. there is noodles in my cake and cake in my noodles. haha.

sara na : it combines adventure and relaxation in a very beautiful way, also beautiful soundtracks, amazing graphics, loved the zen mode, it's just perfect, and it makes me smile :)

manish kehr : so easy to play. smooth. great graphics. and has you hooked from the word go. a worthy download.
russel llabores : this game makes me miss someone who doesn't even exist; makes me miss places i've never been to. makes me miss skyrim. maybe because of the snow?

ravi tej kancherla : amazing visuals and incredibly good music makes it a favorite. the zen mode is the icing on the mountain.!!

isaac joshi : this game has really peaceful and enjoyable graphics and musics. the gameplay is exactly what you would hope for in this type of game.
lukas : great graphics, beautiful music, and great concept. definitely my favorite mobile game.
tyme night : absolutely gorgeous game. the gameplay is smooth and flawless, and the soundtrack is a gorgeous, relaxing mixture of piano, strings, and percussion instruments normally expected in an orchestra. though the game is an endless runner (complete with the power-ups and other mechanics commonly found in the genre), it shows that such games can bring so much more to the table. if you're looking for a peaceful yet engaging way to spend time, this is it.
salem kazi : big shout to developers for making a zen mode! absolutely love it!

firda fairuz : i'd like to play more games like this
ben m : addicting
paul smith : a great spectacle of how much a smartphone can achieve design-wise, a breathtaking scenery with an impressive 3d effect, and an adventurous journey filled with andrenaline. avoids being too repetitive with a variety of weathers, times and locations which are all equally colorful. plus, a modern and subtle interface giving its background the main role. perfect to pass some time fluidly
daniel krueger : this game is perfect for a quick fix for that "high score" and "achievement unlocked" itch. and it's also nice to just click and go to escape the noise and smog of your daily grind for 5 minutes here and there. and now they have a zen mode that lets you shred snow as long as you're heart desires. with no 'game overs' or angry watchmen to chase you, just plug in your head phones and play in the snow.
bennion sykes : i have to revise my previous comment of this game. i have completed the game twice (thanks to my phone reseting), but only now have tried out zen mode. it completely changes the game for me. i wish every app was like this; without any goals or high scores to beat. now, one simply plays the game for the heck of it and stops whenever.
robert jones : to be fair, i'm a bit of a sucker for an endless runner. the problem with most of them is that they are incredibly goal oriented and twitchy. while that's not a bad thing, it can be distracting. this game does it right though. from the simple and beautiful music to the jaw dropping visuals, this game is amazing. a caveat though; if each snowboarder could be an in app purchase as well as unlockable, that would be cool.
calean sixes : noodlecake lost its fame when it made too many games and very few are good. thankfully this is one of their good ones. one of the most beautiful games out there. furthermore its success is in its simplicity, no need to add front flip no need to add anything. the one tap/or hold makes the game even more enjoyable. just wish this game was payed for so it don't have ads and anything else but an enjoyable game.
ashvin panicker : finally finished! really loved the visuals, the concept and the gameplay. although i did keep having an issue with resuming my game after a pause and not being able to jump. also it would be cool to have a trick when you loop de loop through an archway. grind bonus op!
ackhmed aizat : this game offers refreshing graphics, soothing background soundtracks, and endless fun. the trick detection and gameplay score a right balance between challenging and in-your-face. though funnily i encounter occasional stutters whenever the elder starts chasing me, and gone when it's over. overall, awesome.
marino courtoreille : love the new zen mode, very relaxing to just play the game an enjoy the soothing sounds, really helps calm me down. the only problem i noticed was when i went for the really big air, when i landed, it felt like the character either wanted to go through the ground or wanted to crash, same as landing on the power lines from a high distance. other than that i love playing this game on my free time
indigo : oh my word... zen mode. thank you. you guys are a talented bunch - i cannot thank you enough for making this free game even better without exploiting its free-ness. i'll always have a reason to come back to this game, and hopefully support you for being great developers. thank you.
obadah alfaham : a well made and very addicting game. aesthetically pleasing. the design and the music are very nice. relaxing and enjoyable. good upgrades so that it stays interesting. the only game i've ever played where i'm okay with ads because they're well placed ads, like having the option to watch an ad to revive, so they're not annoying or in your face.
spaghettifetus : this game is just amazing. its stunning visuals and beautiful soundtrack just astounds me every time i play this game. it's also not the type of freemium game where to get the best experience you have to pay for everything. its gameplay is so simplistic but addicting. i would absolutely recommend this game to any casual player, or any player in general!
kartikeya mehta : this game is sooo relaxing, especially the zen mode. you can play it for 1 hour at a stretch. graphics are sooo good. this game might have some boring stuff too like just surfing, but yeah, it super relaxing with nice music. :)
anas al-abdulaziz : the one game that i just loved so much from the first second . very relaxing awesome sound track awesome game play the game is just awesome i have never played a game that amazing highly recommended and don't you even dare play this game without headphones or headsets its the most important part of the game hats off for the creators and developers especially the sound designer i just love you guys :3 also there is not that much ads so everyones happy.
sanket pawar : this is not just a game it's a different kind of experience. zen mode gameplay and it's music takes you in the different universe. very angelic and ethereal music it is. when you're playing this game you will forget all the sorrows in your life.. it makes you feel very positive. this is by far the most beautiful game i've ever played. thanks to the developers that you thought of such a beautiful idea.
bakari morris : this game is absolutely amazing especially for a mobile title. the art sound and gameplay come together to immerse you in the snowy village to create a fun relaxing experience. my favorite part was how the level transitioned from day to night. the colors were stunning and the gameplay challenges were appropriate. attainable but challenging. perfect mobile game to kill time.
steven campbell : so after getting to grips with the game, as easy as the game looks, you learn some skills to make the game even more awesome. if you suffer from depression and anxiety, this game is hands down a winner. for those days you can't even bare to move, this game helps calm your mind and eases your anxiety. great distraction tool. awesome work!
bepi spallanzani : i love this game so much i play this to relax before going to bed! especially now that ther is an added zen mode. thanks for that. i love just getting lost in the game. thank you so much 11/10 just a suggestion add volcanoes in this hihi. or nott might not be soothing. or maybe a part where he goes high going to the galaxy a quick bonus. the galaxy scene makes me relax too.
avisian : people should expect to pay for things of this quality. sound and graphic design is superb, gameplay is simple but solid and enjoyable. really enjoying this. bought the double coin not cos i wanted it, but cos you guys deserve to make money off of this product well done. down with f2p.
div : wow. just wow. this is the most calming game i've played. especially on zen mode. with a bit of fun thanks to challenges the game is focused mostly on calm moods rather than challenges. a different perspective on gaming but well layed out for the type of game.
joseph anderson : very fun and we'll developed game from the game play itself and concerning the decisions the developers have made to make the experience enjoyable. ads are only visible if you want to get some extra coins. no pop-ups begging for reviews. i admire these traits in a game so came here to review on my own. for the game itself, great to pickup and play a quick run or settle down and play for a while. runs smooth with just a little lag on my old s4 occasionally. good challenges and just plain fun. good job!
darla : for me alto's adventure brings me so much memories and it's so relaxing and peaceful.it makes me feel so.....the music is very beautiful..it's just an awesome and new experience for me. i've never played such a relaxing mobile game ever
a j : such a great game, it's fun amd addictive with beautiful scenery and non obnoxious music. a good balance of easy and challenging without being boring or annoying, plus you don't have to spend money if you don't want to :) highly recommend
sean davis : this game is amazing, my new favourite game. it's not too easy but easy enough to master. i have no complaints. the graphics and sound are beautiful and it's not tiresome, i love trying to beat my score as it's not a chore to play time after time.
robert williams : it's beautiful. so elegant, graceful - there's so many small moments of delight with this app that transcend the simple screen experience. the emotional reaction you'll have from this game was clearly well thought out by the developers. experiencing my first zen zone while waiting for my coffee, outside a cafe... i think i may have teared up! if you want an app that's going to let you feel joy from simplicity, get this. kudos to the developers; particularly in letting gamers experience your game, without forcing them down the pay to play path, and making it optional.
thomas barr : if you didn't catch on from the icon picture and the poetic description, let me be the first to tell you that alto's adventure is one of the most aesthetically pleasing games out there, both visually and sonically. it's on that same level as smash hit. it's for the most part an easy and frustration-free endeavor but quite gratifying. the new zen mode supports this peaceful ethos surrounding this nonviolent and experiential-centered game. 5+!
grace ham : this game is so simple and peaceful. the art style, music, and graphics are beautiful, amazing, and wonderful. it has taken my breath way and stolen my heart. i absolutely love this game. they have a zen mode and it is my favorite thing in the game. it is just so blissful.
paris andreou wellness gr : i hadn't played video games for a long time before alto... this game is stg else. it teaches you about life. personally i've learned to appreciate time more and all the seemingly little things... i've learned to let go of stress more easily... to keep going when the going gets tough... all weather is good weather after all, and there's beauty in all things, bad or good... you can only get what i'm saying by playing it. playing alto is a wonderful experience, it just made me feel obliged to give stg back.
sreeraj r : the game is really good. and the 5 star is for the older version. the new update is full of bugs. the screen flickers through out. the option like play again .. pause menu options responds tooo slowly... pls do make it correct
mgamgam : it's one of those games where you run and avoid obstacles (jetpack joyride, minion rush, etc etc) but this one stands out by a lot. there's even details so small yet simple like rain, thunder, or day and night. as a bonus extra characters are unlockable and instead of the only difference of character and character, they have different statistics. great game overall, and really enjoyed it!
shirsho jyoti : awesome soundtrack, artistic graphics, dynamic weather change makes the game environment much better than that of any other mobile game. the pacific mountains turn the game experience into a refreshing break from daily jobs.
navaneet baruah : an innovative way to connect on a psychological level coupled with soothing music and picturesque ambience. the zen mode is one good stress buster. but please don't downgrade this game in any way. this is one game that i find is a piece of art
why : some times though the rock spawns behind the building and it's quite dumb to die to something u can't see
sean engle : i find myself getting lost staring at the beauty in this game (which often causes me to lose!) there's something about this game that brings me peace. it's fun to play and not frustrating to lose. weather and daylight changing keeps it fresh, and there's llamas.
vaino leppanen : nothing complicated here. this game is well made and fun. i especially like to try double and triple backflips. the sunsets, sunrises, and stormy weathers add a nice touch.
paul danyliuk : also the latest updates (the one bringing zen mode) introduced a few bugs: power-ups seldomly not being picked up, screen going epileptic when smashing rocks, player suddenly losing velocity mid air and starting to freefall etc. also would love less repetitive music maybe something procedurally generated like the levels themselves?
jesper hauerslev : one of the most beautiful games on mobile. the art direction is simply amazing and the game itself is so easy to pick up and play but hard to master. it is the addition of the new zen mode that makes the game a real winner though. it's such a great way to unwind and just enjoy the game's beauty and amazing music. wish more games were like this. it doesn't all have to be about highscores and in-app purchases, you know!
verity filipow : this game is gorgeous. it's so simple, but so beautiful. really reminds me of journey in that regard. the seasonal/ day/night cycles are beautiful, and the scenery is just really, really pretty. i'm all for beautiful games, what can i say! even the sounds are fantastic. i've no had any technical issues with this game so far (galaxy s5) and everything runs smoothly. a fantastic, highly addictive adventure, i really can't recommend it enough!
brandon roman : this game is straight up awesome and so relaxing. i hope you add more maps and more power ups in a way that doesn't take away from the peace of the game. great game overall, loved it.
danny martinez : i absolutely love this game but i have one little request. add more slow motion. and add an effect around the screen or stop the music when it goes into slow motion, then resume the music when you land the jump. please
ari : awesome graphics (cute & realistic), perfect for a very hot summer, no annoying quests or anything whatsoever, fun accessories (like the wingsuit and the magnet), characters with different skills... the only thing i need now is advice on how to jump chasms effectively! ;d
jeff morris : thanks for removing the crashing and obtrusive ad. this game is brilliant and lovely to play. a simple flip never gets old! great download. *update - zen mode is very cool! relaxing fun during a hectic day is nice.
jake v : love the game, amazing graphics and music. there needs to be a game like this but for mountain biking. the only i can think of to improve it is more game modes
morgan freeman : the beautifully crafted game design runs perfectly with the slow music even when your speeding down mountains
eduardo pradana : game is simple, tap and go down the hill. game's atmosphere is awesome. they have day and night and dawn, rain, storm and snow. character selection. i wish they had more costumization
bala krishna : weather changes, sounds and game are good. but it is taking more memory, and battery drains quickly. may be for high end phones. overall it's good.
varun mittal : i love this game, but after the update i found i serious bug in the game. while playing sometimes the prayer completely stops jumping after tapping the screen. i have to close the game and reopen it again then it starts jumping. look into the matter.
tushar chaudhary : i love the calm environment and the quality in its sound. i love listening to the very real sounds of the rain..
adam cobbett : i am now playing this game so much more. during one play i hit a rock and just left it because i landed in such a beautiful spot. you can now admire the beauty of this game even more than before.
sackrefied : it's an allround great game, the visuals, the ui and the gameplay. the music is kind of repetitive would like some more tracks
scott adams : this game is definitely a step up from most mobile game offerings. it's simple, with fun challenges and easy controls, plus it's visually stunning and doesn't use up a lot of battery power.
purvik rana : it's a great game. you'll have great experience of playing this game and yeah, game sounds is awesome. never get board out of this. download it and experience it.
carlos cristerna : i was looking for a game like this, that feels like a dream. great graphics and incredibly relaxing music and natural sound effects.

kayle wilson : seriously, it has been a long time since i have played a game that i have enjoyed more. from the game play, to the graphics, and music everything was done right. thank you for such a fun clean game.
neil bothma : i can fully relate to this game, i feel like you have to do what you love and must in even the darkest night or the brightest day and in any weather and when you fail or fall you have to stand up and try again... therefore i love this game...
jordan baxter : i have never felt more immersed, more at peace with any other game i played. i can react and relate to all the problems and it's a wonderful experience. definitely recommend this
basinbot20 : this game has perfect scenery and nice music to listen to while snowboarding down a mountain.
mehdi : this is such a great game, and the addition of zen mode makes it even better, it's so relaxing to sit and play it with headphones
bill f : awesome side scrolling endless runner. wish chained/consecutive back flips kept your combo streak active, but that is my only suggestion to improve a near brilliant app
dude guy : i've only played this for a few minutes and i can't even describe how beautiful this game is. it gives me goosebumps just listening to everything. :o :d
ilias kordoulas : an amazingly fluid game and one of the most or maybe even the most beautiful game i've ever seen on mobile. amazing in all areas
adam foster : the whole game is perfect, very smooth. arcade mode is fun, and challenging and zen mode is so relaxing. the game revolves around the sound track. as the sun sets the music fades and calms, then as the sun rises, it grows and becomes triumphant. masterpiece
daniel brubaker : pure eye candy. so great to just load up zen mode and get lost. would recommend.
gideon villena : zen mode is absolutely fantastic. as if the game wasn't already good, the zen mode addition made it even better.
itsmemakz : the simplicity of the game makes it beautifull in a way where you get distracted by a wonderfull sunrise between mountain peeks. a beautifully planned out game, loving it
sentiwapang longkumer : love the background song, ambient noise and the changing weather..very addictive and simple game play .. level 41 now..determined to unlock the last character :d

denis deniska39 : cool
arefin islam sourav : addictive
dhaval thakar : loving it
aaron tadioan : cool
eliza lmb : lovely graphics, simple and very enjoyable gameplay. there are no interrupting ads. there are some levels of challenges which keep the game interesting. this is probably one of the best and certainly one of my favourite games. i only wish they would make more levels because i finished them all and now i just have to beat my own high score (which is still fun enough).
robert bangcoro : this game features a diverse environment which caters an immersive gameplay. it may be perceived as confusing at first but it is guaranteed that users will enjoy. skiing down the mountain has never been this fun and as i catch llamas, backflip on steep slopes, grind the bunting, slide on ice patches, escape the elders, and unlock more characters, alto's adventure proves that it is indeed one awesome game.
samuel james : this is a very nice game. i love the art style and once you get the hang of it the challenges do become challenging. my only criticism is that the icon for the app doesn't make sense if he was doing a flip and going in that direction then he should be facing the other way.
joseph merola : this game is the quintessential side scrolling arcade time waster. the graphics are great, an ever changing background & landscape, good music, you don't need to spend money to have fun, and zero glitches. one game i'll never uninstall and always go back to.
nabil wadi : after a long time i have played something really good. graphics is awesome, especially the changing of a day and night is really an eye candy. most importantly it's lite. after playing for a couple of days, i am giving my review. because, this game deserves it, yet the developers didn't ask for good ratings like beggars. loved it.
anam khan : i don't know when it happened. i only came to recognise this after a couple of months of abandoning the game then playing it again. last month was a personal disaster and i blame my lost mind. i traced back trying to find the reason of my change in behaviour pattern until today. i realised this game has become a channel to keep my focus sharp. it is not tough so i can play long. it has a pleasant environment. and playing this for some time before bed maintained my brain waves. fact proven.
anthonius y. : addictive and mersmerizing. but there is a minor glitch when the player was diving too fast and hits the ground while switching to the flying suit. it enters the ground and got stuck (the meter stops) after unequiping but the game does not end (the player is stuck), please fix. the rest are just fine and great! worth 5 stars
andrew waldroup : this game had been a constant bored at work kinda game, i just finally unlocked all of the characters. since i have been playing this so much i decided to buy the one in app purchase which is a coin doubler, figured it would help the developers out with this game and maybe encourage them to add some more characters or areas.
chris tyler : fun and relaxing and exciting. funny thing happened the other day though. i was going down a hill, i jumped, hit a rock, and then fell into a pit, without touching the ground. the game over screen never came up, just leaving me watching the days pass by. the pause button was also gone, and the back button wasn't working.
o1 : i normally do not review apps, but this game is genuinely amazing and fun. it's relaxing but it isn't boring or slow! the art is absolutely amazing and the music is wonderful! the ads aren't in the way and are actually really smartly placed where it isn't a chore to see or anything (i don't know how to describe it lol) overall, i definitely think this game is worth downloading.
a google user : excellent game... i think people those are complaining about insufficient tutorials are too lazy to find those tricks by themselves. my only complaint is the lack of option to stop auto changing whether.. please add it ...plz
pedro martins : it has no bugs, it looks beautiful, the color schemes are pleasing, the weather dynamics are captivating and the whole environment is awesome. amazing flow, easy to play but with a challenging learning curve that allows for cool late game. the characters and theme are original, the music adds to the magic. when a bug made the game unplayable, they fixed it sort of soon.
umang shukla : really great effort from developer. with minimalistic and awesome graphics, this is a endless snowboarding game with a continuous weather shift. goals are achievable and unlocks new players (each have its unique quality and that's another awesome thing). a new high is achieved when i unlocked wingsuit. i hate endless running games, but this is a pure exception, and with an open heart i welcome you to my top 5 games.
benoit hogue : i don't typically enjoy endless runners, but this one is very nice. after playing the game for i while, i sprung the 5$ needed to double coins (forever) simply out of wanting to support the developer because the game is fun and deserves encouragement. that's the only thing one can buy. the core mechanics of the game are well thought of and fun to play. the challenges keep the gameplay fresh and interesting. if i had one negative thing to say is that this game eats my battery for breakfast, twice.
vinayak nair : this game has no complex plots or controls,all you need is a finger to tap and a sense of timing.the only problem i've faced so far is that during the night i need to increase my phones brightness to see which drains battery life quickly.
mj's two cents : alto's adventure may seem simple at the start or you may confuse it for another running game. but believe me, this is am experience of it's own and is artistic, relaxing and very fun. not addictive at all, but rather something you'd go back to for relaxing, not competition. edit: please add cloud saves.
a google user : this game is wow in every sense. from the setting, to music, to tasks and everything. got me hooked from the first day. i don't know i'd ever finish each and every goal but i look forward to it. p.s. back flips used to be the most frustrating thing for me but it feels awesome now.
m o : with very simple controls, tap to jump tap and hold to rotate. it's an easy game anyone can play. however with the levels and challenges there's always more to do along with aiming for highscores. (i'm currently at 120,000). unlocking new characters is always fun, as they all ride differently , maya rotates faster where as paz rotates slower. i am looking forward to unlocking more. would 100% recommend and have to friends who also love it.
levon arabian : one of the best games i have ever played. the scenery and the games design as a whole is fantastic. i can't stress enough how breathtaking this game really is. the gameplay is smooth and a fun/addicting experience without the rage. all things considered it is amazing how great this game is and how a tranquil game like this one remains free. alto's adventure, a dazzling game.
rickandelon : please make the visibility of rocks better in next update, also add avalanche tragic, wooden bridges, cable transportation scene, some more power ups ,off line competition within some other characters such as maya if we are alto and vice versa, other wise wonderful game it reminds me of himalayas and everest adventure. totally worth it. thanks.......
cakepoprock : i love the music and the rain is the best part! every time i use headphones and rain comes on, it's so realistic i say "hey, when did it start raining?" and my friends all say "oh emma! it isn't raining!" also! it has recently been freezing in the beginning and sometimes through the whole thing so now even though it's my favorite game(that i recommend my friends to) i now play it less because it hasn't been working. ;(
daniel hughes : addicting, fun and enjoyable game mechanics, great sound effects that add to the game, fantastic graphics, and most importantly not over run by ads. one thing the devs should fix is the watch video option to revive alto because that never works for me
nicholas reynolds : i always like to have a bunch of puzzle/strategy games with a couple arcady games for when i don't want to think. i downloaded because it looked like the kind of arcady game i wanted. it was more than i hoped for, such a relaxing and beautifully designed game. the devs clearly understand attention to detail. the background is pretty, the changing landscape is a nice touch, the weather, birds, and other small things really make the game. the music is calm and doesn't get annoying. the missions are fun.
vikrant nandrekar : the game has everything a successful game needs to have. a beautiful game level design, great soothing soundtrack and easy control system. the continuous day night cycle is a joy to watch and not to mention the material style approach to the game design. controls are easy and engaging with a good points system for style combos. a good way to make you watch the ads as well as the game is free to download.
christine schultz degama : great atmosphere created with cleverly simple graphics and a pitch perfect soundtrack. with zero lag, jumping and flipping feels great. lots of content here, also. i couldn't wait to see the next set of goals, as they become more like dares from the dev. beautiful and fun, a must play!
spacemoose : endless fun, good job and thank you to the developers. one problem though, don't play this game on the toilet or you'll never go due to all of the butt clenching moment's. this game has to be causing widespread constipation from the puckering that comes once you realize izel is speeding towards his doom in a gap you can't get out of.
thishen packirisamy : alto is a foremost example of realism in intra-personal relationships. throughout the adventure ones ideals are questioned and forcefully put to the metre. like a balloon the entertainment value of this games rests on a 3 legged milking stool. and like stool i would rather not eat it
eli kacal : i can barely play this game outside of my house because the night cycle makes things too dark to see! even with my brightness turned all the way up i cannot see a thing while i'm outside. i would appreciate it if this was fixed. other than that, i absolutely adore this game. like this is the best on the app store.
a google user : this game is awesome. it's very entertaining and i love the visuals. the only thing that i don't like, as others have complained about, are the rocks. some of them are too hard to see, especially the flatter ones. but overall, i really enjoy the game.
swamy g : let's put it simply. i don't review games. this is just magnificent work done by the developers so credit to them. i find myself sucked in, not so much by the gameplay, but the environment. it's perfect for a game that doesn't require too much brainpower.
mac kincaid : absolutely love this game, it's nice and relaxing to play while still being fun enough to keep you starting a new round every time you faceplant. the different goals and challenges keep things interesting, and the options for different characters are great. (esp the llama!) really appreciate that you can enjoy play without being constantly asked to spend real money; you get the option of watching ads to revive your character and continue the same run, but you're not constantly pushed to spend. a+++
alexander aguilar : at first i thought it was going to be one of those boring endless runners. here you don't even run. you play as alto, a herding boy in a snowy mountain and your llamas just ruin away. you have to catch them by snow boarding down the mountain while going in style. the artwork is simple and beautiful, relying heavily on pastels and soft colors. the music is one piano piece that is very relaxing and changes the further down the mountain you go. a few levels in, you'll start unlocking new characters,
p c : alto's adventure is a pleasant spiritual successor to the skifree game on my first pc in the days of windows 3.1. skifree was a refreshing interlude among the likes of doom & wolfenstein3d while alto provides the same from the more complex time sinks of today. simple yet seamless graphics & gameplay in a visually relaxed & pleasing environment where you can spend 5 minutes or a half hour w/ ease...all the while wondering if an abominable snow monster is going to show up to eat you.
mergedpotato : i initially downloaded this game because i thought the screenshots looked nice, and boy did the game deliver. usually graphics aren't a high priority for me, but alto uses it to create a soothing and beautiful atmosphere. the gameplay is nothing crazy but chaining tricks and running from elders can be an odd balance between relaxation and thrill. if i had to complain though, the mission system can get annoying and it'd be better if all goals were unlocked right out of the gate.
a google user : it seems like it's just a score-attack game & not an actual 'adventure.' also wish there was a way to buy coins for those who don't want to watch ads to gain more. but still a fun game so it deserves 5 stars
a lex : i like the game a lot. it is so beautiful to look at and the music in the game is pretty awesome. and i like these kind of games, platformers. i'm not sure if you can actually call this game a "platformer" so i'm sorry if i'm wrong on that point. :} but, yep, all i wanted to say is that i loved the game. :}
harith dinie : i love this game. the idea is so simple yet innovative. however, i will give one criticism that it is a bit hard to know whether you can or cant crash through the rocks. because jumping over them slows you down and the elder is pretty fast so...
benito valenzuela : very simple and elegant, the changing background is nice from night to day, sunshine to rainy to snowy, and the different types of characters all balance this game very well. would love to see more updates/added levels maybe, or even a hawaiian theme.
alla gadassik : why aren't more mobile game developers designing games this smartly?! it's relaxing to glide through the snowy landscapes in the game, jumping over hurdles and doing tricks. but it's also diverse and challenging enough with the small trick missions, so that each run feels different. no intrusive ads or manipulative purchases, hooray!!! this is really a perfectly designed game, and i wish there were more like it. i would gladly pay for it, if they wanted to do a second installment with future levels.
yosua abraham : the scenery & music in the game is strangely nostalgic, made me want to try another run just to hear it once again. art style and music are totally beautiful and perfect match for intriguing endless snowboarding without unnecessary gimmicks and tricks. the character unlock based on leveling is cleverly made.
j mula : ads. after the latest update, constant ads - causing game crashes.. will not play until they roll back this update. bad form. will change to 5 stars if they remove the game breaking ads!
gregory somers : at 1st it can be tough, but achieving lv goals helps you figure things out and at lv10 u get a better character. watch video button can become your ally in finishing tough goals. even if you die attempting a goal, you might get it. focus ahead! you don't have to use the newest character to achieve current goals. save up for the wing suit! you can repeatedly get 500 gold by simply watching a video by pressing + symbol on final score screen.
nathan cunningham : this typically isn't my genre but this little game looks great on my nexus 9 and is fun. the backgrounds look great and the mechanics are simple and hard, but they do get repetitive for any hardcore gamer. gave 5 stars since cloud saves was added and much needed too. note after last update music is now choppy and distorted @ times and ive had issues with ads not playing then randomly starting during a game causing my nexus 9 to crash. please update resolution to 1440p or 4k id like to push my n9.
abdul shahid : i am in love with this game. you just need to download it once and you can enjoy this all the time. the most wonderful thing is, it worksoffline with no interruptions. very happy with alto's team. keep it up guysssss... love u all.
bohan, oliver : after playing it alto is a very calm, subtle, fun, yet challenging indie game that i fell in love with. it is one of the best games i have ever downloaded. if i could rate more stars i definetly would.
shayan mukherjee : don't think twice if u still haven't found a nice game. just download
t pench0 : this game is truly a masterpiece. it has simple controls and amazing artwork. provided me with hours of entertainment after my internet went down for 4 days. i only wish that there were some more game modes but other than that i can't complain.
tristan ivan rhy atienza : wonderful! amazing! superb! those are the 3 words i can describe this game. so let me first start it off with that the whole game itself is aesthetically pleasing from the animations ( i really love the details espcially the time zone in the game which is trully mesmerizing ) up until the music which is soothing by the way. the second one is that the controls isn't that very hard, by just using one finger you can play this game anywhere you want. lastly, the characters are very detailed and have their own pros and cons which adds depth to the game (but i recommend you still add more in the future ). the some goals are very hard to say the least but that is what makes this game challenging and that males it more fuj and enjoyable. kudos :)
diae : it runs smoothly and the graphics are just phenomenal! and man, the sound effects, it just feels so real! like when there was a thunderstorm in the game, i thought it was raining outside too! i'll give this game an 11/10. though, i do wish you can make the character do frontflips(?) too, whenever you press on the left side of the screen.
neon : this game is so much fun and amazing. not only did the creator focus on the fun aspects of the game he also focused on the landscape. that is probably my favorite part. just watching the days and nights cycle through and watching the rain and snow. anyways great job creating this wonderfully put together game
matthew kee : i've never been so happy with a game before and this is definitely one game for you to play. lovely graphics. i wish we could select the game mode like choosing the time, whether to have someone chasing you down the mountain, etc. could play this for hours..
judgemental budgie : this is one of the most amazing games i've played this year. graphics are beautiful and the animation is quite detailed. gameplay is easy and relaxing but can be challenging at times. i highly recommend.
kevin mclean : simple, easy controls, relaxing music, no ads (or freemium), just a great game. aesthetically it reminds me of monument valley
josiah mccoy : the game is super addicting, no ads, only micro-transactions which are not pushed or required to advance. the art style is beautiful.
paul summerfield : this by far is one of my favorite mobile phone games ever. definitely many hours of enjoyment await you! update: finished all the goals and want more. please devs make a new mountain with new goals. also, i would love to see extra challenges once you completed the game! an easy way to do this, (hope you are listening devs) put advanced players like 100,000 meters ahead, so its much harder!
niklous mikaelson : this is the game that has everything so far for me...i will strongly recommend it to my friends...truly speaking rain is the best part
dreenkolor 91 : nice game, with beautiful graphics, the sound effects and dynamic weather. you need some luck in certain stages, but eventually, they can be completed, just as i already have. enjoyed the game. thank you.
jeff walker : love it. can't stop playing it. the feel of the environment is breathtaking, although it sometimes is too dark when it's night in the game, but daytime at my house. the interface is simple and the tricks are easy to do, so no complicated combinations, but the timing is everything.
kenan dutchman : amazing game. love the music quite calm and the art style is amazing overall love it one thing that i will be even more happy if you fix the revive buttons i can't watch an add to revive my self but overall amazing game. keep up the good work!!
brendon packer : this game is absolutely beautiful, smooth and soothing. the scenery, the music, the textures and the gameplay are all perfectly done. a simple game yet so addictive because of how well it has been made. my personal top game on android right now.
a google user : very good game, the music is very relaxing, offering a good counterweight to the nerve-wracking gameplay speed. the angular background and foreground graphics are unlike any other i've seen, they are simplicist but contribute to enhancing the eye-pleasing factor. it is the absolute best distance adventure game i have downloaded yet, i do not think there will soon be one to rival it. there is every reason for it to be an editor's choice app. cheers to the developers at noodlecake studios and snowman!
aoife wright : the graphics are beautiful and the concept is addictive but when it turns to night, i can't see anything and is very hard to play
a google user : this is the perfect game for a phone. simple yet challenging. the objectives are fun, and the map is always random so you always have something new to play. iap aren't necessary to win or advance. i'd pay for an ad free version if there was one.
swaroop singh deval : reasons: 1) small in size and consumes less ram. because of this, it doesn't hang even in low ram mobiles. 2) even though it consumes less ram, graphics and features are pretty good. 3) no age limit. everybody likes it.
wasif haque : beautifully designed visuals with great attention to detail and a very soothing soundtrack makes for a wonderful experience that is alto's adventure!
bill branan : simple to learn, fun to play. clean graphics, music that never gets old or annoying. just the right level of difficulty to keep it interesting.
kyrupt : this game has turned my life around, i was in a very bad state, my mum had just passed away and i got diagnosed with depression. one day i was looking for games to play and i found this, its relaxing music and himilayan backround i couldnt stop playing it has helped me alot and i just want to say thanks
milan ivanovic : excellent game to kill time with. also developers are not doing everything they can to grab money out of your pocket, but instead have polite means of earning their keep. more games and developers like this should be present and are more than welcome!
nirban debbarma : thanks for making such an awesome game. the visuals and the background audio score is excellent. weather effects with themed backgrounds make it more beautiful. *one request, background audio scores should be more and the characters too. thank u for keeping it free.
muhammad firdaus abd halim : great games to wash off my spare time. i'm wondering, by any chance, this game available on windows apps, it could be great too
joey newcomb : multiplayer would be really awesome. i haven't checked the tecent update as of writing this, but the llamas don't make llama sounds.
ananta pratama : it's simple offline game but really entertaining.. cool and awesome movement combination, with cute and unique characters, and challenging mission.. me and my friends are actually addicted by it.. so.. let the stars speak.
joe : brilliant game. the visual style is amazing and the music fits the game great. my only faults are that it gets to dark at night and that it will turn off the screen after about 15-20 seconds of not touching it.
cahyadhi prayogo : this game is pretty simple, yet it's very addictive. almost got all the achievement, except the last one
jacob joseph : i think with more tricks in this game bedsides hitting backflips would make the adventure of this game with alto. more funner than it is. u guys should really work on that .
justin & melissa robertson : this a very excellent game. it is worth getting. the game is very high in quality and never lags. also is a great time killer and a all around good game
srisri satish kartik : i really loved the game. visuals are outstanding. music is so nice. i l like the way how the days time change. but nighttime is a little bit difficult
mugen mugay : great game elements and mechanics provided! i didn't know we could unlock more characters after reaching level 10. it gets more exciting after that as i feel the urge to unlock every one of it. i love that it has various missions each level. that's why it is never boring!
j. dau : the soundtrack alone is wonderful. add the seemingly simplistic game style and this is definitely a game that you could play on a work break or spend an evening trying to get as far as possible. added zen mode, just makes it better.
kaloyan dzhamdzhiev : really eases the dry season for me :d the game has a great feel when you play it. i love the challenges so far. i would suggest to add more tricks. those backflips are a bit boring after a while. thanks for the great app! cheers :p
memorii. : i have been playing this a long time and i love it but pls fix when getting the power ups it doesnt activate. you just ride past it i dunno maybe because i've been playing this a long time and also the nighttime too dark. thank you for this game and pls fix!
sean benoit : this game is an awesome snowboarding game but one thing is that things weren't descriptive. i didn't know that those men on horses were elders
satish rawat : game is awesome with its simple looking scenery and the concept of the day and night snow fall and rain, i just love that
tom lynch : this game is fantastic. i'm going after the final achievements and i still play it a ton. really the best graphics and smooth play on a phone i've seen.
zombianca : this game is so simple and sort of boring that it really should not be as fun as it is. but oh my god, it is the most relaxing and entertaining games i have ever experienced.
kyle virtucio : best breath taking environment, peaceful music, great sound effects, and stunning graphics. i can't believe just a little mb can make a game like this cool.
anthony b. ano : after playing stressful fps & rpg games, it's always great to fire up this game to calm your nerves once in a while.
desirae h : love this game i'm so addicted. it's a great endless runner just a snowboarding version but with some additional features like ur wingsuit and different characters with different abilities. lots of fun and a great time killer
darkstar : i downloaded this game 2 hrs ago now i am a super fan of this game. i like it's sound, graphics and weather yes weather it have many types of weather and many more things to find out. i love 'noodlecake' many - many thanks for you.
austin grover : graphics are stunning. unlockable characters with different traits is super appealing. missions are fun yet challenging. a bonus is its not pay to win .
jesse v : kudos to the art and design. feel 'adventure' is a bit of a misnomer, since you go back to the start every time.
a google user : absolutely stunning game with very nicely done monetisation. great game for kids as it's very simple to start playing. me and my five year old love playing this.
padi engel : the graphics, the soundtrack are just beautiful and the challenges and unlockables keep me playing this great piece of art.
prakriti bhatt : i absolutely love the graphics, the interface, and the background score. this game feels like a break, and isn't stressful at all. also, no unnecessary ads interrupting game play. undoubtedly the best game i've ever played on phone.
michael dinglasan : just a beautiful game. love the way the environment changes and the day/night cycles. controls very nicely too.
dominzs : i play this game every night before sleep and work, i enjoy how the game doesn't give me any grief when i play it. i'm not cluttered with micro transactions and adds i am just able to play and have fun
autumn w : love how indielike the game is. only thing is idk how to get past that guy that runs after you
marnus van zyl : play this about everyday for the past two weeks. really fun, nice challenges and beautiful music and visuals
gunbileg nyamdorj : this is a great game. best graphic. my only complaint is that i wish it had forward flipping option. but still the best game i found so far
a google user : superb visuals and sound effects. brilliant gameplay which is both simple and challenging at the same time. makes you wanna keep sliding down the mountain.
a google user : amazing game sometimes i cant stop playing it. graphics are stunning and the sound is awesome but i think it would be great to be able to set the weather and time of day you want. oh and add snowing pls.
alex kong : you ski through some beautiful environment. i love how the day and night changes as you progress. it's a serene and relaxing gaming experience.
a google user : beautifully made game. love playing it, but didn't at first. takes a bit of getting used to before you do well, but very fun and addicting once you do.
nur fatharani : tbh at first i downloaded it just because of the name, i didn't know what is this game about, i just glance it once and downloaded it. and then i saw the introduction and got very excited because of the ilamas xd btw, everything are sooo beautiful. the music, the graphics, and of course, the ilamas the sceneries are really gorgeous! i love the sunrise, very beautiful! very well done!
chauncy bernard : awsome gameplay,awesome video graphics epecially with how the environment settings change. very good game ai. get this game now and start playing and be amazed.
brent : i really think this is the greatest of mobile gaming right now, stunning graphics, excellent sound track and no p2p model. well done with this game!
gilbert bautista : thus is the best looking game i have ever seen, the scenes are beautiful, and the music is so perfect, its calming in some way
raman sharma : one of best endless game and graphics are too good. even very less game play elements but the game is very well implemented and gorgeously presented. thanks for developers for such a lovely game. hoping to get new things in upcoming updates.
rishabh : good work devlopers,nice graphics and peaceful music,wish i could give it a 100 stars.a must have game
richard reynolds : some of the challenges are quite hard but being able to pass them using in game coins is great. thanks for making such an enjoyable game.
darcie : this game is so fun and pretty. i can waste hours on it and sometimes the graphics leave me near breathless.
shantanu tonde : in that version show blood and broken limbs when player crashes and may be you can show some monsters instead of the elder or the rocks. you can integrate it in the same game too. just give an option in settings to choose between vanilla and gore version.
mothusi lehata : the game hooks you from the word go. short achievements which always give a sense of satisfaction. whenever you unlock a new carecter it changes the game. well done guys.
shreyas tripathy : the game in itself is pretty nice but the music and the graphics are extraordinary! i love it when developers focus on the feel of the app rather than cold functionality.
anthony evans : rocks are unavoidable, some characters just can't get the speed to make some chasms etc, but as i got better i started to fly through the game. frikken frustrating at times but fun too
mohit mayank : one of the few endless runners which doesn't become monotonous just after a couple of games. plus, awesome graphics.
jaylen : this game has really good graphics it is sometimes hard but it's a really fun the music is so beautiful that's my favorite part of the game
a google user : this game is fun to play and it's cool to look at all the little details in the game. i love how the day time nd weather change too. simplicity of it is awesome too. very fun!
christopher degama : this is one heck of a fun game. so simple, yet very satisfying game play. i love the graphics and bgm; they set a wonderful scene. perfectly paced challenges help you become progressively daring and creative. i highly recommend this. excellent work!
annisa hanifa : i rarely to comment for games but now here i am . this game is so simple yet so addicting . the main reason may be the animation and graphic because it's so smooth and cute and dream like . only one problem when in night cycle it's harder to play because i never see the rock is coming but maybe it's just part of the game still fun tho !
michaela nilsson : i used to play ski safari a lot. but this one is really well made. the graphics and sound are fantastic. crisp and smooth gameplay
turbo killer : amazing, probably one of the best indie games that i've played but some of the missions are incredibly hard or way too situational
benjamin hage : love it period. but i do have to point out that alto can only do back flips so why is he doing a back flip and landing switch on the shortcut pic. just saying....
kilo x silencer : i remember when it first launched and it was the first 2d game done on this scale. it's just gorgeous and the environment is pretty

istvan krizan : the game design is very nice and the gameplay is enjoyable. however i would like the option for turning off the day/night cycle. it's hard to see at night. i rate it 5 stars just because it have a lot if space for more stuffs and hope it would have some new features in the future.
mel : this game blew me away, not because it is high addictive and fun, but because of the perfect background, graphics, and the soothing music that is accompanying, that totally enhances the gameplay that makes it even more fun to play with. i myself don't get associated with games as i delete them within week due to their boringness but this game is totally different on a whole new level and i would like to compliment the developers for making this great game and would also like the name for the music. g
chad botha : this game is magnificent. well done noodles... canadians for the win. absolutely love this game. i die in the game but only because of the scenery and the change in weather and time patterns being so diverse and refreshing. please make more games like this and you'll have much more praise by me. and that's saying a lot.
ratul islam emon : i just love it. background music is so comfy. best gaming music ever i had. just one thing, use some tips if we can't complete the tasks. i know u gave it in the first level. but would be better if u put it beside the task if we keep failing to complete the task. **i want more games as like this**
scott s : there is something very special about mobile games that actually take care to put effort and passion into their product; alto does this with style. rare are games that are fun and honest and not just trying to reel in the idiot whales to spend piles of cash on their garbage virtual addiction machines. alto is thoughtfully designed, fun, has beautiful music and is generally a joy to play. if you're looking for an actual mobile game, give it a try, it's great.
sajid alam : truly a marvel to play. i have been playing this from when it was exclusive to ios and required a fee pretty bummed about that but it's worth it. the visuals, soundtrack and gameplay are simplistic yet captivating allowing me to indulge hours worth of gameplay into it. it's a definite recommendation from me if you're looking for a light and beautiful game.
jay lowe : i had a problem with a reoccurring ad popping up during gameplay which i emailed the developer about. i received a response almost immediately and although i haven't checked to see if this has been sorted yet, the communication that i have received has been amazing and shows a genuine concern and level of customer satisfaction that is unfortunately not witnessed often nowadays. full credit to the developers for a great game and a brilliant attitude.
tom coffey : i'm so glad that i've had to play so many boring and sub par games in my short lifetime to appreciate this game for what it is. the graphics are breathtaking, the audio soothing and subdued, the gameplay smooth and comfortable. everything about this game is beautiful. a sure treat and a game i wish had existed years ago. it makes being awake late at night peaceful. all the thumbs upwards.
doom badger : there is something quietly wonderful about this game. the mechanics are simple and the physics is sublime. the graphics are wonderfully subtle, with the day night cycle and weather effects creating some eye catching moments. progression is paced just right although after a few days a bought the coin doubler which is well worth the price if you're playing as often as i am. a fantastic little game. give it a go.
satan sama : it has a life. it lives and breathes. well, that's what it feels like when you play it. by the artwork, music, sounds and physics, every element in this game makes you feel like this world really exists and it's beautiful. gameplay is very fun and the trickiest challenges you face to level up(and unlock new characters) are not hard to achieve if you just spend a few minutes exploring all the different ways you can travel in this game. it simply feels like a journey.
tom griffiths : other developers take note: this is how you do ad-supported. unobtrusive, optional adverts when you want to continue after a failure. not permanent banners nobody wants to tap, or forcing the player to sit through annoying ads to play the game. the gameplay is also great, and the graphical style and music are both excellent. can't fault this game.
john barnabas hughes : it's my go-to for a fun/skill combo. i wish it could sync progress over devices, as i often switch. i also thought paz was a massive disappointment to unlock. i cannot fault this game, only offer suggestions for added features like the synching. the gameplay is tight and almost lyrical. beautiful game.
shyam vasudev : this is a very simple yet perfect game, the art and the music is so soothing. the ambience it gives is so good. the gameplay is simple but as you progress, you unlock more characters and they bring in a lot of variety and changes to the game. the iap does not make much difference and most of all it's free on android. download this game without any second thought.
ghayas baig : this game is very nice. i've been playing this game for a long while now. the only problem im facing is that i re installed the app after which my achievments are reset aswell. even though im signed in with my google account and it shows my high score and achievments aswell but the game starts from level 1 :(
jack xhemali : i usually play mobile games for maybe a week or so then delete it and get a new one. this game however is fantastic in its art, mechanics, and music, and i absolutely love it. one thing it could use is maybe a leaderboard kind of deal so we can see how we compare to our friends.
chris laplante : such an amazing game. reminds me of ski free for windows 95, but way better. ost is great, graphics and mechanics are superb! fun and addictive. thank you for a great time killer. also, the game uses no data, ill put my phone on airplane mode and game runs with no problem, you just cant revive by watching a video because youre on airplane mode. best game for a phone ive played in a long time.
will francis : this is a great little game that blends skill and speed into an enjoyable time-wasting diversion. the replay value is definitely high. the graphics look gorgeous and really capture ambient light well. no need to pay to win either. my only complaint is that i wish once you beat all the levels they let you go back and try and complete any you may have skipped through coins. but that's a small gripe. definitely download.
a h : this game has surpassed the likes of subway surfers, temple run etc easily. i was amazed after playing this one. beautiful picturization of events. loved it i'll recommend everyone to have a go at it once. only suggestion plz add the day- night option coz it becomes difficult to play in dark rooms or at night.
richard cagle : love this game. smooth controls, beautiful animations, and gorgeous art abound. i found the leveling challenges to be tough but fun. i really dislike the day/night cycle. at night it loses a lot of its aesthetic appeal because things are just silhouettes and rather than it making the game more fun, i found it frustrating to run into a rock that blended with a tree. still, fantastic game. play it!!!
adrian anderson : elegant graphics and decent physics. not a lot of "help" info however. took me a while to figure out where to change the character - main page, little bubble that looks like "sharing" next to sitting character. otherwise wildly intuitive (some characters do backflip faster than others).
atandor : amazing game. amazing graphics. amazing gameplay. well done to the developer(s). my only two very small pet peaves; somtimes going into an add can black out the screen, forcing me to reset the game. and i find the game to be slightly repetitive (especially when ur reaching longer distances and ur waiting for something interesting) . otherwise one of the best games out. :)
hannah klasky : hours of fun, limited ads, quick replay, and constantly changing landscape make this game a pleasure to play. not to mention it's just plain beautiful! i feel little to no stress playing this game even when i die, as there is unlimited replay and pleasant music and sound effects to keep me calm. keep up the awesome work game designers!
tim span : no idea how to get new snowboarders, you end up getting chased by a guy on a llama without knowing how to beat him. i'm assuming just go faster but that means doing tricks all the time unless another snowboarder goes faster
timothee c.d. : i used to like the fun of ski safari, but alto is more my kind of high. only thing maybe is, as good as it is, i don't see enough incentive to motivate myself to beat all the challenges. past level 35-40, it gets a bit repetitive. looking forward to the next adventure.
amey talekar : i can keep playing this game for hours. it has amazing 2d visuals and the cleanest graphics i have seen in a long time. the background score blends beautifully with the scenery and the setup. an additional bonus, despite being free it has minimal advertising nuisance.
smile more : the definition of a mobile game, that you can waste you time on, i could pick up my phone open this game sit down and a smile would slowly come about my face because of the peaceful nature, music, and gameplay. very smooth, nice, and to be honest ( the wingsuit is the best thing of all time. ) gorgeous animation, and controls by the way 10/10 to the devs.
kill _me : ok i have had alot of fun on this game but there's a small bug. sometimes when we tap the screen he doesn't jump. this has been happening alot. please fix and thank-you so much for making this awesome game!
dean walker : this is very strange because the gameplay is so simple, but i find myself addicted to this game. the music, the graphics, the dynamic weather, everything is just so great. also, the game is not that hard to the point that you need to spend real money on it like other games out there. the music. its just so good that everytime i play, i wear headphones. if the creators would share the music to us, that would fantastic.
andy ho : i don't normally do reviews on my own but i must applaud you for this game and more importantly the ad free aspect makes this game so much more enjoyable. all that i ask for in future update is to provide an option to disable day cycle, the night time makes it hard to see what goes on.
lost ezekiel : this is the best free to play i've had the pleasure to play on android so far. its aesthetic, its music are charming. it's simple yet engaging and challenging. and its monetisation is so well done every other game should learn from it. it is the kind of game that you would expect not to be free, given how good it is. i cannot recommend this enough. if you haven't tried it yet, stop reading already and click "install". you'll be glad you did.
hera sharif : i have never left a review for any mobile games before, but this game is phenomenal. the graphics are absolutely gorgeous. the transitions between day and night, the sunset and the sunrise, weather effects and particles are distractingly beautiful. the music is very well done and serves the purpose of creating a calm atmosphere just right. the mechanics are pretty straightforward and there's nothing to complain about at all. all in all a beautiful game sell worth your time.
fatal kill : love the real time background cool graphics best gameplay. your trully amazing guys! can you add more enemy other than elder chasing, like pack of wolves or polar bear and pls. add more freestyle tricks to get more better. backflip is not enough tho.
stefan miron : i usually don't make game's reviews, but this this is an exception, very good graphics, performances and beautiful ideas .... i founded 2 little bugs : one is with the ramp - when i have maximum speed and wingsuit activated i reach the end of the ramp and the games thinks i have crashed... the other one is the same thing - maximum speed, wingsuit and when i bounce from a rock the player is instantly smashed into the ground - i mean i'm exactly into the map
a google user : i love this game. i generally don't like these endless runner style games but this one is well made with simple yet gorgeous graphics. the music is really nice too. i've been addicted a few weeks now
tejal sutrave : here you are playing and enjoying the game n suddenly your player crashes from the snowboard. then u see what happened exactly and then you come to know it crashed on the obstacle. so,there should be a way to disable day night cycle. because it is very difficult to see obstacles in night mode. otherwise the game is very amazing. loved game
amanda fowler : this game is so well made and easy to use. the whole style, atmosphere and graphics are very calm and soothing. everytime i open up the app it sends me on a journey and i love every second of it. i would recommend this game to anyone of all ages! i love the fact that the ads on the game or a choice rather than being forced on you. it makes it so you want to watch ads so you can revive the charcters and keep playing.
hari prabhu : one of the best game i've played so far. graphics are top-notch, game physics are amazing, and especially the music and sound effects are unbelievable (the sound effects of thunders are freakingly life-like). shows you guys worked really hard on every single detail. kudos!
ethan hayward : very fun game, great graphics. there's just one thing that bothers me. no matter how fast paz goes, he always trips over rocks instead of smashing through them.
casey owens : this game is to good. i won't to see this grow so much. i never pay for games but this one i would. id even pay for add one or a second one. this is a group of heard working creators that get how to keep you addicted to a game without making you give up real money. just so great nice job guys thank you for making this small beautiful world for me to just kill sometime in. and to the artists. they clean lines smooth colors and lighting . it really makes this feel like a beautiful outdoor mountain experience.
leivon sanjay : goals are good enough to hook you up for a long time. but the real charm is in its visuals. retro-styled minimalistic graphics are hard to ignore. atmospheric sound effects really brings the game come to life. shifting in day-night and in weathers is so seamless. landscapes are so beautifully created. no gamers could skip to glare for a moment further away mountains at down as you sliding down with your skateboard. definitely recommend to everyone!!
miguel colon : this game is awesome ! you just pick up and play. one thing , you guys should add multiplayer like versus. me and my freind love this game the only thing that would make it perfect is if we were able to face eachother. but other than that great game noodlecake !
roman shah : one of the best (perhaps it is the best !) games i have ever played. the graphics and sounds are beautiful, rarely games get good as this. and the best thing: a buyer can get the same thing as a non-buyer, they just need patience and some skill. the only thing you can buy is the coin doubler. truly, the best game i have ever played.
catherine : it's a brilliant game. the graphics are beautiful and the scenery is a thrill to see. it's a basic upgrade game where one can pick up coins and spend them in the shop to buy things that might better their next score. there aren't many in app purchases that i can see; there's only one that can double your rings. there aren't many advertisements either, only the ones you can choose to watch in return for 500 coins. overall, it's a pretty good game. though you're pretty much doing the same thing over and over again.
j freeman : gameplay, music, background scenery is absolutely beautiful and stimulating. i can't help but be reminded of game journey while playing this and i have a feeling there's a connection. this one is therapeutic game play and i keep coming back. thank you developers, please continue making more like this!
laura lockwood : easy way to get proximity flying goal (discovered accidentally)! activate wingsuit and fly along a stretch of bunting (i did it over a chasm). the bunting counts as the ground so you can fly as close to it as you want without smashing into anything. done and done! oh and this game is awesome. download it.
vincent chee : alto is art. it is a luxury feeling to play this game after a long day in train travelling home. it is nice to see, and beautiful listen, the whole experience is unique. meditation-like music and detailed crafted sound effects. it is enjoyable to listen the music although it has only one music track for the whole game, but you will not get bored of it. the sound effects crafted with harmony with the music, it has no over exaggerated sound effect to enhance the experience. you can tell the texture of the snow by the sound, the speed when wind sound getting louder, even the sound of crash is so nice to listen (the 'gong' sound). the beautiful art. different scenario will change throughout the day, and every scene brings unique feelings. the beautiful sunset, starry night, snowy day, rainy day, vibrance day time. the music and graphics matched perfectly well, too much enjoyment from this art piece. thanks for bringing out the feeling of snowboarding to people like us where snowboarding is impossible. i enjoy very much, thank you for making this game.
matthew demas : alto's adventure is an excellent endless runner game. it's easy to play and provides fun, optional challenges that result in unlockable characters with unique abilities. the visuals are crisp, minimal, and beautiful. the music sets a mood that inspires wonder while providing relaxation. it's completely free to play with a smart revenue structure. once you fall, you can either start a new run or continue that run by watching a short ad or paying with coins you've easily earned through gameplay or purchased.
harun akar : it is one the best games i have ever played. it is simple and playful. the graphics and musics effects make it more beautiful. i love the realistic weather phenomenons and the light effects by the weather and in addition that the sound effects. when it snows, when it rains, when the sun sets and rises you really feel it. i would like to thank all whoever was part of this game.
batmon wayne : at first i was in doubt in seeing the "2d" art style of the game but after a few seconds my mind clicked and realized how every detail down to the sound and animation when having performed a backflip was perfect. very few devs can execute a phone game to this level, the game doesn't attempt to facade something thats it's not. the leveling and in-game currency are not p2w and executed very well. the game is simple yet has a skill curve, the combo system is well made and the music matches the flow very well.
peter o'neill : great gameplay, beautiful graphics and they have really nailed the free to play model with rewards for watching adverts but you can choose not to and still have the ability to progress. well done guys and thanks for making this.
nathan oshea : this is probably the most used game on my phone. i play it all the time if is so addictive. the art style is amazing as you can see from the pictures. if i had to choose from 1-10 (ten being the most liked and 1 being the most disliked) i would choose 11/10. overall i would highly recommend this game.
anupam tiwari : addicting adventure with sweet music to calm your nerves. one can play this game for hours. best thing is you don't need internet connection to play. we dont have internet everywhere, game are the best timepass at such places. but many games of this age require internet. thank this game is very useful.
vikramajit singh : such a beautiful game and that too with a great overall gameplay. it's such a rare combination of perfection. and the bonus is, it's free. i totally loved how time and season changes, accompanied by such natural sound effects, snowboarding through the forest and the adventurous gameplay of course. it makes me miss the mountains. no 'game' ever did that. but the repeating soundtrack gets boring at times. if more such beautiful soundtracks can be added to the game, then it will become a complete package! :)
greg r : on first start up, mind set of a simple game. soon turned into enjoying every aspect of detail. from weather, and day-night cycles. to the fast pace. enjoying every run i make and goals that i can achieve. great job guys, keep on with the exciting work.
luke jackson : i don't normally write reviews but i couldn't resist with this app. this game feels and plays like a $5 game but it's free! the graphics and lighting are some of the best i've seen and the gameplay keeps it addicting to come back and play. there are goals to work towards to maintain interest but i do feel more cosmetic items should be introduced. overall this game is one of the best free games i've played and there aren't even ads that interrupt gameplay.
carlos : what is up with the feather power up, its more like a power down, so that i go out of my way to avoid them. like, i feel like im going slower than before? and i completely hover over rocks and coins... maybe im overreacting, but please consider a better powerup, maybe like a invincibility powerup. it would have the same benefits the feather is supposed to have, except you can actually pick up coins, and you are able to rock smash. i dunno, just a suggestion.
greta galbraith : if you like games that are pleasing on the eye then this is for you! beatuiful backdrops, day to night cycles and weather systems all look stunning while you speed down mountains and through villiages. the gameplay is smooth and flawless. ads are annoying but you don't need to watch too many, just start back at the top of the mountain if you die. love the level up tasks and the progression through characters. addictive!
themissingpatient : this game is calming as a time waster and a lot of fun for free gaming. easy to play anywhere, any time and the simple graphics are easy on the eyes.
vinit rathod : i am in love with this game i just loved the graphics and also the background sounds quality. mostly i don't play games but this game is just awesome i am addicted to this game thank you "noodlecake studios inc" for making such an awesome game...
harold reyes : please help me retrieve my previous alto game. screen of my samsung galaxy note 2 has been broken and i can no longer use it nor recover my files and games. i already unlocked the first unlockable character (girl; you can see it on my achievements). my level is already above 10 but can't remember the exact level i had, even the items i purchased and their levels. this is the first snow boarding game i ever played and i can say that this is one of the best android games ever. i hope you can help me recover my previous game and in the future, there will be an option to save the game via cloud or so. thanks!!
zackariah ausgotharp : the app always crashes after in game ads are shown, not the ads you can watch to revive alto but the ads for other noodle cake games that usually pop up after you've completed a run or when you launch the game. not entirely sure but i think it fails to record the data prior to the crash, unfortunately. other than that all i have to say is that it's a pleasant-to-look-at-time-killer with nice music and great atmosphere. really pretty from a humble artist's perspective. thanks for making it free.
jose velazquez : beautiful game, but man does it love it some battery. and don't touch the processor end of your device after playing for a while. don't care though, totally worth it when you watch the sun rise in the distance as you ride down the mountain.
maja vencel : my phone update marshmallow and the game started hiccuping and slowing down it slows down much more when it's in the trees. when the graphics are more intense
ananya bhardwaj : great game, it's beautiful to look at and easy to play while being an endless runner that's difficult to do. great, great experience playing it. one of the absolute best games on android. more developers need to learn to make their games as visually appealing as this.
justin anderson : i wish there were more games like this; not only focused on interesting game-play, but on building a good atmosphere of a game. smooth music, changing environments, simple and clear setting- yet beautiful- and it is truly relaxing. even if you fail, you don't really freak out ( maybe occasionally. but hey nothings perfect), you just start back up and enjoy the ride down the miuntain.
pratik jadhav : this will be the first review am writing! this game is just awesome, i have just started and it will be one of the games am looking forward to playing for a long time. also best part is the soft music playing in background. it's just relaxing ..keep on sking
sharath kumar m.s. : this game is a visual treat! it takes you on an epic journey , changing weather and daily sun and and the moon cycle. what makes this game so outstanding is it so close to the nature and the mystical things happening around us that goes unnoticed in the busy world we live in. playing this game is truly an adventure and like a psychedelic trip on the icy mountains. thanks to the developers and the team who gave us such a wonderful game filled with love and positive vibe. :)
why keen tham : wonderful game! just a comment about the paid option though. it's not really compelling enough for me to spend the money on that feature alone. i still paid though because i love you guys and want to support you, but maybe next time figure this out? maybe the wingsuit would be a good paid option?
a google user : this is a beautiful game. who could ever tire of watching lamas slide down snowy mountains on their bums? it's challenging, yet addictive and it's so nice that you can actually play all of it without having to pay. it's worth watching a ton of videos early on (i kept hitting the "watch a video" button whilst doing the ironing) as this will enable you to 'purchase' useful power-ups with the coins acquired.
bruce glennon : great game. level progression is smooth and obvious, and it is easy to unlock the most fun characters quickly. you can watch ads for money, which is a nice way of implementing f2p. excellent.
niel coetsee : i've had this game for about a year and only got to rating it now. i should've rated it earlier, but rather late than never. this is truly an exceptional game that can soothe and be fun simultaneously. brilliant visual design and music with a cute theme going on that makes you forget you're losing hours into it. the game offers many challenging yet fun and rewarding challenges that keeps you coming back. i can't recommend it enough. thank you developers for still producing quality free games one can enjoy without forcing any microtransactions or advert on the player. a big ol' double thumbs up from me!
n!te wlkr : at first i didn't like this game but i really got into, its almost addictive. really great game but its still missing features..well not missing but suggestion like character customization. but very awesome game and nice job for making it
tyler murphy : i really love this game, i play it whenever i have the chance to, but my friends also have it so whenever we play it at the same time we wish we could play together. please add a multiplayer mode to play with friends (disregard if already workig on multiplayer mode).
rey dagal : i love the design of the game it is graphically relaxing to the eyes, it follows the graphic trends. the app runs smooth, i like how the seasons and time shifts which was pleasing to the eye i hope that they create another version of this probably for 2016
tom mcdonald : this is one of the greatest android games i've ever played. you can play in 5 minute bursts or hours at a time. the ambiance is very relaxing and zen while at the same time nail-bittingly intense. the music and sound effects are amazing and the graphics blend perfectly. all in all, i can find very little to fault this game. while there are iaps in the game, you do not need to them complete it. everyone should try this game out!
nurul farhain : this is one of the very few games that i'm very, very satisfied from the first play! i really love that it has day and night view/cycle and i really love the bgm too, it gives me this kind of nostalgic but calm feelings. the animations is so smooth and beautiful. great job dev team and i hope to see this game improve for something better (tho actually it's very good already, but no one says no for good improvements, right?)
a google user : i like this game for many reasons - easy to play, simple, addictive..but probably the best thing is the atmosphere. from the sound effects (i turn off the music - not because i hate it, i just love the sound fx. they are spot on!) to the visuals - the sun setting over the mountains, thunderstorms rolling in, night and day cycle - they really have created a superb atmospheric game. the only downer - and this truly breaks the atmosphere - is the ads you have to watch to revive. a pay version, ad-free please!
david zita : this game is immersive...the scenery and soundtracks will blow you away...simple and addictive game. i give 5 stars to this games, they worked hard
mathew samuel : usually i dont review apps, but the elegant vibrant artwork and music does deserve appreciation. the sound of rain, the dusk landscape...it has so much just to relax ur entire day!
akash lamkhade : the is simplistic and beautifully designed. the game play is easy and fun. i really loved the design of the game. elements like the sun, it's lens flare, the change of weather and the mountains. the soundtrack is also soothing. overall a very good game. keep up the good work going developers.
aditya damle : i travelled 50000 m the first day... so i must say i am addicted. it's really very interesting. i just wish we could perform a lot more manoeuvres than just back flips... just to make it more interesting
andrew james : avoid the feather! wish i could go back and sell the additional timer i purchased. stupid feather makes you miss all of the ice boosts and most of the coins. not a "power-up" at all, but a hindrance! also, points mean nothing (unless it's for a challenge) so don't worry about llamas or horns. coins are all that matter. otherwise i think this game is smooth, fun, addictive and beautiful! almost to level 60!
medico : finally a game to be played for fun & relaxation. wonderful vector graphics, perfect audio & visual effects, not to mention nice soundtrack. this game is extremely beautiful & serene, with some innocent children facing the ups & downs of life with fun & bravery. they enjoy their life without any grudge against anyone. again, its just artistically wonderful. suggestions: well just add a bit similiar but new soundtracks & add strength to wingsuit mode. my best wishes for the team.
gabriel palmer : this game is wonderful. i'm not 100% sure i like the advertising mechanics, but you are never forced to watch an ad. i guess the devs were a bit greedy because watching an ad gives you 5 times as many coins on you'll earn in the average run, so you can earn upgrades faster by watching ads rather than playing the game!!! that said, ads are completely optional, and upgrades don't help you that much anyway. the game is utterly beautiful, with so many small touches: weather, day/night cycle, etc. and so fun!
a google user : i love everything about this game. visually pleasing and fun to play. i also like how they don't hold their hand out for more money.
ricardo : fantastic game!! very well designed, user interaction is very well thought. easy to learn, lots of fun to play. graphics are superb, animations are really smooth. almost feels like you're snowboarding on the andes! pick maya as soon as you can, so you can easily link one stunt to the next with back-flips, for added score and fun.
ashish rajak : great, sober and soothing design. i like these kind design based games with amazing adventure because i'm bored with all crashing, blasting and attacking. there should be some games without these things that can amuse. tupa is my favourite character.
farhan shaikh : this my one of fev game on my mob ...when i playing this game then i forget this world. i will 1000 time death for this game..thanks snowman n thanx alto
john doe : amazing game! it's simply but gives you new challenges very often. only downside for me is the in game power ups aren't common at all and upgrading them is therefore pointless, and are normally placed near nothing
emmett p : everything about this game screams perfection, from the beautiful graphics, to the flawless mechanics, to the peaceful music, to the goals that are just hard enough to make you want to keep playing. i can play this game for hours on end.
jaejoong min : love the settings, esp the dusk. i've been playing it non-stop ever since i downloaded the game. love it, great job. and btw, love the lack of ads (i did watched a couple of them ads though, because i wanted to extend my life and is a cheater xd)
business mails : good game , but i found a lag in the game. i was running using paz than in game paz strike with stone during game. as per rule game must be over but immediately game over but paz was running. i found this error.
prashant tudu : what a beautiful game. it's simple but challenging. the graphics are beautiful, gives you a calm emotion with its graphics and music. wow.
nitesh khatri : this is a really cool game. really loved the day night changes. you may work on different weathers as well like rainfall, snowfall, wind blowing or storm.
rthorofthehillppl : i just downloaded this game last night and already felt compelled to rate it 5 stars. the design is simple yet fun and the visuals are beautiful in their simplicity, as well. all in all, this is a great game anyone can enjoy.
ian scheid : yes the single option to back-flip makes/breaks the game but the challenge is compelling. catching air seems like it should get some point bonus even if no back flip happens.
koto gray : this game is so serene. it has to be one of the best games you can have if you need to calm yourself or just chill. the better you get at it, the more enjoyable it gets. a must have. after a while you can almost believe you are in the game
diana jennifer howard : hello guys, i had to change my review here after i installed the game on a new device which i boughy last week all my game progress is lost and i am not able to play from same level on which i was on previous android device ,it's a critical issue ,the same id iwas using in that device same id here too so it should sync the progress from google play server,kindly fix this issue
justin gibson : beautiful graphics.. just wonderful, and very simple! i play this game a lot, i recommend this game to anyone and everyone of all ages. there is one idea i thought about if you developers want to do it... it would be cool if the game were 2 players.. or maybe even 4 if possible to have a race down the mountain or something. or who can gain the highest score under a certain time limit. i'm not suggesting change what you guys have, but if you were to think of multiplayer, then those would be some ideas:)
jimwel anobong : implied simplicity yet amazingly stunning. clean in terms of visuals and prove that you need not to be that excessive to promote nice gameplay. idealistic to the developers by the way. nice job
sam & courtnay boateng : this is a beautiful game, however, my little sister was playing it and wanted to watch an ad to revive herself, and the walking dead ad came on and scared the daylights out of her. if your game has a young audience you probably shouldn't be putting violent, bloody, zombie ads on it.
alannah peacock : noodlecake studios have worked their magic and created alto and his friends for this mystical adventure. i suggest get it. best free game ever.
lyle cable : i love the relaxing music & the way we see day night cycle. it really is a work of art & other game developers can learn a thing or two. i hope in the near future you guys add more levels with more wonderful music
minh nguyen : i really enjoy playing this game. kinda repetitive, but it gets more difficult the further you go and they are challenges.
rahul walia : the peaceful music,the graphics every thing in the game makes a bit you
relieved "for me a lot". moreover it gives you a game experience too but in
a more cozy way.
angelstar76 : the aesthetics of this game hooked me. i normally wouldn't play this kind of game but i love it. game goals are achievable without being too easy or hard. no pressure or need to purchase in game options to keep playing. you only see ads when you want to.
sean de la rosa : love the game. graphics are the real deal. but please make the night time more visible like put on some lights and stuff
o0smoke0o 1 : easily the best never-ending runner style game i've played. super smooth and looks nice. also challenging - great work guys.
stanlin alexander : absolutely beautiful to play and ascetically. controls are easy and simple to master. the only complaint is ads on android version. i would gladly pay to get rid of the ads
kimura ryosuke : the graphics and sound track in this game is amazingly beautiful. its so relaxing to look at it and listen to. gameplay is smooth. quite challenging, nothing great, but best way to pass the time. p/s game keeps crashing when trying to play videos. please fix.
emerson green : i know the area is fictional, but i'm so confused about what mountain range the one in this game is inspired by. the names and presence of llamas implies the andes, but i don't think it snows there too often, if at all. the bunting wire flags, architectural style, and snowy mountains also imply the himalayas.
a google user : really fun and skill intensive endless runner. it feels so good when you get a long combo going. the minimalist graphics are really nice.
ben cooney : so much fun, what else can i say. thank you hard working devs for a great game :)
shirish upadhyay : really very great game. it's an art piece. great background , good use of colors. playing it is more or less like a meditation. music too is a good part of it . god bless to those who are involved in creating this great game.
gabriel c : seriously, though. you guy's didn't even ask to rate it! i came here out of free will and gave it 5 stars. this game is what the world needs. simplistic, smooth, great soundtrack, great mechanics, not pay2win. you guys are magical beings, congrats for the awsome game.
aaron myers : it's great and don't give up if you can't get a certain goal. some are pretty tricky
suleman mughal : i like the art and layout of the game. the day and night cycle is beautiful and innovative. i think this game can get better if the weather and stuff like avalanche also plays a role in the game and more item in the workshop.
matthew dannatt : superb rendering and smooth game play coupled with pseudo-random terrain make this an absolute winner for kids of all ages. highly recommended.
zack wise : beautiful, fun, addicting, free, no annoying ads. this might be my favorite mobile game ever, so much so that i paid for the one in-app purchase so i could support the developer. you won't regret trying it out.
anish shakthi : the graphics and the lighting makes me want to play more. and not to forget the amazing sounds the game has got. :)
abdul hakim abdul rahim : very beaitiful game, down from graphics to the music. i enjoy it. do keep it updated with new things once in awhile. thanks dev :)
a google user : it's fun, and beautiful, and doesn't ruin the experience with nuisance ads.
ramesh manjunath : simple game play. awesom challenges. but not worth paying on apple. because its a paid app on app store. here it's free and its real fun.
lisa shadows : one of the best games i've ever played. never had problems, despite the fact that my phone is very slow. the only suggestion i'd made is to make the high score number more visible
riordan pett : the graphics are beautiful, i just wish every game has this iphone-like frame rate...maybe it's the minimalistic approach, but even the blurred high graphic menus on the game are just smooth. smoothest game released thus far. anyone know any more like this??
a google user : simple graphics, easy to play and relaxing music are just some of the things that makes me keep coming back for more.
oliver mandel : a beautiful game that makes you learn its mechanics step by step in a very nice manner. 12/10
pritam : absolutely love the game and the whole experience. however, share button does nothing at the score screen.
willy hu : like i said in the title, it's the perfect distillation of that feeling you get when you're just skiing/boarding down a freshly powdered slope, and it's just you and the mountain and the sky. the graphics are gorgeous, i've seriously taken more screenshot of this game while playing it than any other app (shaq-fu is a distant second), and the music is perfect. endlessly soothing, but challenging enough that it's addictive. literally the perfect mobile game.
nicholas hanson : i could come up with a bunch of ways to say how fun and captivating this game is but, that's just it the game is brilliant. its fun, it has replay value because objectives keep me going and the music is so calming, keep up the good work guys!
vic thor : wonderful addictive game. infected with in game purchases and the usual bullshit nowadays, but the "not that annoying" type. if you like this, try "canabalt"; same kind, less beautiful, slightly better gameplay and two player mode this one doesn't have.
jacob sutton : i really enjoy this game. it keeps me entertained for hours at a time and never seems to lose its luster.
max burcham : i only have one request.....please please please add in some type of altitude meter. its impossible to tell how high you are off the ground and it makes it difficult to guage how many flips you can do
john fadul : but with the most recent update the watch video button doesn't work - all you get is a black screen and a run ended
jamie broad : great game, from a free perspective it's a breath of fresh air to not have a revival system that requires the use of "gems" or some microtransaction currency, rather a quick 30 second ad or the use of in-game currency if you really want that high score. my only issue with the game is that a higher frame rate would be desired though i'm unsure if that's to do with my device (the more likely reason) or the optimization of the port. it's somewhat frustrating to have a good run going only to be stopped by a rock that suddenly clips into existance when the frame rate stutters. i'm also unsure of why there seems to be nothing but blank space in the settings menu, is this a bug or just a result of the port not having this option? if it's the latter, it would be gratefully appreciated to be able to disable particle effects or change their intensity to improve performance.
chevon champier : paz is a bit buggy when he's going really fast. rarely sometimes when he's jumping a cliff he'll clip through the ramp and fall in the cliff. 5 star because you can tell why...i have paz now lol
shuusuke kagamine : i don't usually rate, but this game is awesome. by the way, any chance you could also add the option of swapping the wingsuit icon to the right side? i'm left handed. i tap my screen w/ my left hand. i found it hard to fly properly since i got my wingsuit since from time to time i end up tapping on the icon when my suit is fully charged.
kane ferguson : completely great game. everything from the visuals to the soundtrack and sound effects are done astonishingly well. i recommend headphones if you play though just to ensure you don't miss out on anything.
based scout : 0 aggresive ads, one of the best looking games, design, music and background sounds are simply beautiful. trust me you won't regret downloading this game and you won't spend a single real life money because you simply can't.
lilsparrow 22 : one of the most relaxing, addictive games.. i love the consent change of weather and day to night.. what am i saying i just love it all
christyr belacqua : this game is beautiful and smooth with the perfect level of challenge. whether you're chasing llamas, or collecting coins, to grinding a massive combo this game is absolutely amazing! the sound effects and music are beautiful and the game plays like a fantastic work of art! 10/10
shailja tripathi : trust me i find this game really soothing with all the background and music. you can never get bored with this game in ur hands. simply it
robbie t : this game, though simple, is a masterpiece of music and visual lighting. i loved every set piece and background, every jump and slush of snow. amazing game.
antoine emond : finished the game , it took a long time for a mobile game ! looks awesome and no ads unless you revive or want more $ . 1 in game transaction wich 2x the money you get .(just a purchase to help the devs). great game
verity aequitas : from the amazing visuals to the soothing game play to the non pay-to-win model, this game does it all right. i even bought the iap to say thanks to the devs. great job!
anusha rani : but please make the gamer a bit larger .. unable to see in dark places.. so. apart from that it's just awesome
anoushka bhalla : its not only the game itself but the graphics and the sounds which are so, so soothing. i never really write reviews for games but this time i was really compelled to. it is absolutely amazing.
amanda snow : a quiet escape that very honestly just is what it is and thats wonderful. nust lay to understand the element of smoooooth challenge you can relax while being unable to stop from obsessing over.
lucas gracia : super fun, elegant tasteful graphics, not too hard to play but challenging enough, several "lifes" unlike other games so it allows you to achieve more... one of the best games i've played by far
chetan agrawal : everything, every little detail, the concept, the continuous sunrise and sunset, the flawless design, the background and colors, the glitch free and smooth running, the tutorial and goals handling...literally everything is perfect.
tim : hands down the best game ever. very nicely done and awesome to play. can't get enough of it and i never want it end.
sam hatherley : tough but not too tough missions, subtle but cool add on features, no pay to play and the graphics and music are stunning and relaxing
janin palafox : can't believe i'd love this. the adrenaline it gives you while playing it. surely the game's weather and morning to night condition makes a good role in distracting players. makes you to get used to it and more motivated to play the game. it's simply amazing!
ashutosh pandey : some "noodle" something game ad is coming while playing and crashing my game. rectify that asap.
ethan moehr : the game is very fun. kills time and is relaxing. if you like arcade/indie games this is a good game for you.
swarup rajbhandari : the down to earth graphics, music, above others the synchronization between them, i never get bored of this game. but one thing is it give much pressure on my battery. care for an optimization may be.
david nugent : i'm not all that good at this game. jumping crevasses is something i just can't quite master. but the game is stunning. the day/night progression is a really nice touch.
vlada zivkovic : the atmosphere is awesome and the game is relaxing. i just wish the flips were faster, it would add more fluency to the game.
jordan brazinski : 5 minutes in and i'm blown away by how beautiful the graphics and soundtrack are. very well done. simple concept executed perfectly.
arena parker : so soothing grapics, background sounds oh god cant resist.. hats off to u makers.
frog warrior : the game is fun and easy. it's a great time waster if you have a few minutes to kill. plus it's free and not pay to win. you only watch the adds if you choose to, and the game rewards you for it with 500 coins.
joshua kallen : the music is relaxing, the graphics are not the greatest but it's perfect for the game. i love the mechanics, especially the backflip and wingsuit tricks. this is a must-play for everyone.
aditya sriram : the game's art combined with its music make for a really soothing ambience. not to mention the engaging goal mechanics which ensure the game doesn't become boring even after lots of plays.
william plevich : beautiful graphics and insane items and power ups keep ading to the purity of this game, great job noodle cake studios and i ask that you update and keep ading new power ups, it is an amazing game again, great job and good luck!
shashank gosavi : surely amazing game i ever played. even with the repetitive stunts, thrill remains same.
suraj subraveti : this game is the perfect package. great music, realistic sound effects, stunning visuals, and most importantly, hassle free controls. the level format keeps things really interesting and makes the game very addictive.
winerius de nella : great graphics and the song too,also the character is ok and gameplay's challenging thx for ur hardwork.><
david von stockhausen : great game. but, alto on the cover of the app is flipping in a impossible direction... if he is going from left to right across the scree , his body would be facing the other way.. :)
dylan smith : anyone who doesn't like this game doesn't deserve it. deceptively simple premise and game mechanics that can keep tou entertained for hours.
nate skepple : i don't think i've ever seen better graphics on a mobile game this simple. developers did a fantastic job. the soundtrack also receives an a+ from me. super fun!
robert naim : i have been addicted to this game for several weeks. but now that i have finished it i feel empty and wishing for more. keep working hard you guys are great
elon collymore : i have not played a better app then this. well designed, looks beautiful, all around great game wish i could rate more.
kyle jasvins : the gameplay is minimalistic and clean, runs like a knife cutting through hot butter. i have to praise whoever did the sound design. the thunder surrounds you and truly gives you a feeling of immersion. kudos
s t : everything is perfect especially the way the ads are in this game, no ads in your face or all over the game. it's optional every game/app needs to be like this.
ky sturgeon : love this game. i play this game regularly. super cool achievments, perfect difficulty level at all times. update: the ending kinda stinks though, i was dissapointed.
shalabh agarwal : great grafics, good characters, challenging levels etc. the thing i liked much is the sound effects and relaxing music. allover a great game
prasanna narayanan : smooth n stunning graphics, realistic physics, good music. overall gameplay is very well done.
richard suter : top notch snowboarding game for your phone. great game play although horribly addictive. catch mountain lamas, get a massive speed boost then do ridiculous numbers of backflips off rails, rocks and ramps!
chris mulkey : alto's adventure is ridiculously addictive. its art is what originally caught my attention, but i keep coming back to level up. i even sided-loaded in my nvidia shield tv (since it wasn't natively available) so i could play on the big screen and despite "official support", it works very well there. (the only thing i haven't been able to do on the big screen yet is change characters, which does make some levels difficult to pass.)
bhargav bose : i always play 3d games for the graphics they have. but this game is so well designed, i never thought i would get addicted to a 2d game.
a google user : very good, adverts are not intrusive, can choose if you wanna watch it or not. also it is playable with out the pay for upgrades.
rifat al jufri : this is the best game mobile graphic ive ever seen, it makes me feel so relax and comfortable, thank you :)
risxn : the music and settings just blow my mind along with the llamas! it's a truly stunning game.i would imagine this is set in peru,beautiful :)
james s. : finally a game that i enjoy. i have been looking so long for an actual game that doesn't require money and isn't extremely difficult. it's a very enjoyable challenge for all levels of players. thank you for this great game.
parag chitale : overall nice game, good graphics, but gets bored after few plays.
alfonso stoa : first of all its pretty, the graphics are smooth and sharp, really enjoyed its gamebility and how you get better and better on spoting details like thunder, rain, birds or thi shinning of a house. its a beatyfull game.
josh suchy : i like how the slopes change every time you start a new run. it is kind of difficult in certain areas but you can start over and try again at any time.
chris shortle : the scenery is so beautiful and smooth, it never feels repetitive. i've tripped over so many rocks just enjoying the view.
abhishek soni : when i hear the music of this game i feel out of the world...i play this game just bcoz of woderful music...
sanjay kar : the game is simply awesome. the game looks so good with ever changing day and night. it's addicting as well. one of the best games ever
shawn leonard : finally a game that doesn't inundate you with ads and is actually fun to play with beautiful graphics. nice work!
a l : would be nice to have a record of your top scores. also the app drains my battery quite a bit. not sure if anything can be done about that though.
suad rabbi : a must have game. great graphics and sound effect. it will really take you deep into the game.
roasted lemon : a really great game with good graphics, no lag, no ads, great time killer, but one problem, its way too easy or was i sopposed to get 11,000m on my fifth try, the only thing it needs is a few more power ups and a tutorial on how to activate the wingsuit
eric reeve : i haven't stopped playing since i downloaded it, so that's saying something. there's an occasional big that pauses the game, but it doesn't happen often.
golem precious : this is a great game, basic idea but somehow quite compulsive. it doesnt require the internet to play, no compulsory purchases needed. theres a few adverts but not really on overkill. would recommend.
ana marko : the visuals of this game are breathtaking. thank you. every screen is like a separate piece of art. your efforts are greatly appreciated ^_^

'xdd) nah, just kidding, the story of the game ain't that bad, it's ok. one thing i want tho: i saw you added the optin to move the pause button to the left or to the right. could you do the same with the wingsuit? that would be great. waiting for feedback.
sammal : brilliant game. beautiful graphics and its the first game that you don't need to spend money on. if you really want some extra coins just watch a 10 second ad. i can not recommend the game enough. so seriously, play it. its free.

vivek choudary : this is the best game i've ever played and the graphics are so good and the background sound is so soothing. i request noodlecake team do make many games like this.
keith b : even the advertisements are a stroke of genius. love this game... and i don't play games on the phone ever. until this one.

caique santos : breaks the capitalistic paradigm that's been building itself on apps nowadays by offering optional video ads and no way to pay for coins. plus, it's really, cool.
gabriel bit-babik : this is a free game that does free right. not only that, it gives fun, long, and beautiful gameplay, providing challenges and characters which flesh out the app. one of the best mobile games this year so far.
kinder n1 : it's clear that this game was made for fun and not for money.if the developer wants to make money they can put ads on this and another without advertisements for money.but people make good games when they focus on the game and not on the money.

tyler nazifi : i love playing this game whenever i have a couple free minutes throughout my day. it gets super addicting and it is a good way to kill some spare time.
yellow octothorpe : what an amazing, atmospheric game. the soundtrack, the graphics and everything else about it is just sublime. the only thing that ruins it is the ads that pop up during gameplay, which then causes extreme lag and then crashes. this is not the way to go about promoting your "cut the rope" clone, noodlecake.

ryx matic : its perfect has great graphics great story(of why he's skeeing) its exciting because he jumps high and it feels like im really in the sky like real life - its just awesome
david sumner : since the update it's glitchy and not as responsive there's a slight delay when you press jump please fix i'm on the last player now with only 9 levels to go would like to complete the game
dread lock : it says paz can smash through rocks at full speed. i am still to see this work. i have let him run with no deviation to touts. and he still smashes into them and dies. how long do i have to leave him running to smash the rocks without having to trick? it doesn't seem to be working.
clint strasler : fun game,, save the llamas! more addictive the further you play. unlocking new stuff is always fun. nothing bad about it at all.
abid hasan : i loved the music on which the game is based on. gorgeous looking graphics added with this natural music.. reminds me of the childhood fairytale fictions..

hoo jun ting : it's 2016, people have more than one device and wish to play the game continuously without having to start all over again in a new device. make cloud sync available, even better allow it to be sync with ios and it will easily be one of the best action game.

chun sang au yong : the only bad point is that you get addicted after playing...
hyon lee : aesthetically pleasing to just look at. overall the game plays very smoothly with almost no glitch. the creators are humble about the ads system where it is completely optional for players to watch. well balanced game overall
jesse : the game looks and plays very well. i have never played a mobile game with so much quality. the graphics are so simple but it fits in really well with the environment and animals.

amir sadeghpour : i like its game play very much. actually i addicted to it! i wish it had less video ads, but honestly it's worth watching the ads.
jared dreyer : when i first played this game on a best buy iphone and learned it was for ios only but also learned it was going to android shortly, i was waiting in suspense. now that it's on android and i can actually play it, i'm so happy. this game is amazing, plus listening to relaxing music with all this scenery makes it that much more relaxing. good job.
arandompurpose : find the visuals well done and the gameplay fairly simple but very fun. sometimes some objectives are a bit too specific but you can skip them easily enough.
jebs m : what is a proximity backflip/wingsuit? anyway it's a super great game. fun challenges and lots of variety with the day/weather cycle. i haven't gotten to level 51 yet but hopefully there will be more challenges/characters to choose.
dave griffiths : beautiful game absolutely would recommend, as a fellow mountain llama farmer i can relate to chasing them down the side of a mountain on a snowboard so the storyline particularly hits home with me.

kyle gayle : i feel the game is very well presented. it's not in your face gorgeous but instead finds beauty within its simplicity. the gameplay itself is simple and easily addictive. the game doesn't give you a million things to do at once but goes at a steady pace. my only nitpick is as soon as night falls, visibility becomes more of a hassle but i feel this was a deliberate design to give the game more atmosphere. overall it is game is by far worth a try. well done to the dev.
john smitt : at first, i thought it had suckish graphics and hard and meaningless difficulty, but i love it... youll find it hard if your not used to flipping and motorcycle games, then it may be a rough start, but after playing for a while you get used to ghow it works, and its great! all people who enjoy good looking games and great concepts should play this, and i just love this.. i think that this is a good game, and one thing i wish couls be added is a slow motion warning when you see a rock, and i love this. ()
matt coe : i'm not a massive phone game person but every so often i'll download the odd one or two and have a little play, however usually they're full of ads or want you to pay this and that.... but alto adventure is just right and truth be told i really cannot put it down, just the odd cheeky run here and there or a good half hour at it. it's not rocket science to do the challenges, they're all achievable. the only down side is that my screen goes on standby if i don't touch the screen for x amount of time
ml : noodlecake has done it again! besides this being an amazing game that you can't put down, there is almost zero pay to win aspects, with no pop up ads or required video ads! no "lives", just snowboard through the stellar himalayas for as long as you want.
landon peterson : the art, the music, the design, the feel. literally everything about this game is great. the upgrade system is awesome, although i wish there were more characters. it's really a flow-state game. if you don't know what that is, it's when you are so focused that you do not stop producing great results. the concept is reflected by the gameplay because if you're focused enough, nothing can stop you. so you gradually increase this ability to increase focus and enjoy the relaxing flow-state the mind enters.
gonzalo casas : i've been waiting for this to be released on android ever since i've seen it on ios! the game is so beautiful, every little detail amazingly executed! one tiny thing: please prevent the device from sleeping, i have a short timeout and sometimes it gets in the way of the game because touching the screen to brighten it up make the character jump ;)
isa akbar : as a achiever type. the missions is quite challenging. always play several swings before sleep
amanda diller : love the simple, artful graphics and calm color scheme changes throughout the game as weather changes, day changes to night and landscape changes. so simple to play, yet never boring. well done!
saul borunda : this game is so simple but intricately beautiful at the same time. one of the best mobile games i've ever played
stefekmek : an amazing game and the best thing it's a game you don't actually need to pay for coins. if i could i would give it 10 out of five.
noelaniis : when i try to, the loading box just goes away and doesn't load or log me in. other than that, i love this game. edit: all fixed, and i love it even more.
vivek kartha : starts out boring but becomes addictive. also sometimes alto doesn't jump due to some bug.
lux halcyon : i fell in love with this game and haven't stopped playing. i'm not sure what tupa's extra power is, despite people saying it's reviving when falling into a chasm because it doesn't work for me. can you guys tell me?
mr wim : great game, played it back in the day on my iphone but i'm checking it out in android bow :)
argon2020 : i love this game, from the beutiful artstyle to the general idea of it. this game is an excellent way to spend some extra time. 10/10
david moodley : this game is so awesome. so well polished! not pay-to-win you can decently play the game without any iap. there are optional ads for coins, but it isn't intrusive.
iylia mohd : one of the best all around game made for android. it would be a great add on if new characters bring.also new music. peace out people..
chetan patil : in game when night occur i m not able to see , don't make it so dark .
bob kevlar : hands down 5/5 you deserve it. these kind of games are exactly what the app store needs more of. good work, i love it.
sunny soni : this game is simply an experience into the fantasy world where we forget everything and just get lost in the moment :) 100/10 if i could rate...
alex vanover : simple mechanics but they stack.. you can only control when you jump, flip, or fly. but when you combine all of those into combos that get bigger and better as you ski ever faster, with absolutely gorgeous, dynamic scenery flying by, you get this amazing game. i try new games off the play store all the time. games like these are what i really love finding.
charan reddy : any developer can create a game .but u really created something else.it's really some kind of magic.very peaceful and calm
f g : black screen after game logo, i can hear background music but no visual. edit: thanks for fixing the issue, now its working flawlessly.

luke shaffer : so i just downloaded it to try it out, i liked the art they used. at first it didnt really seem to have a point, but i somehow managed to unlock the first character and realized that was your goal. fun game i play it while my teachers lecture or while im pooping. its simple and easy to pick up and put down which is nice. good game.
mustache merlin : i had a big long list of reasons that this game is amazing, diving into basic game design choices and stuff. unfortunately, it didn't fit in the review box. however, i highly recommend this game to anyone with a pulse. the craftsmanship is wonderful, and the depth to complexity ratio is insane. this is a beautiful game with a great soundscape and great mechanics. also, it goes surprisingly well with breaking benjamin's dark before dawn album.
zandon : i have been looking for a game as beautiful and fun as this one, it's honestly perfect although character customization (something basic like colors) would be very cool. (this is just a personal want of mine that is asking alot) but some sort of storyline that puts you in different areas with cool soundtracks in like an update way later on.
tyler b : this game is oddly addictive. the art style is absolutely beautiful and the story is hilarious. one suggestion however would be the ability within the settings to replace the game music with music you have saved on your phone, maybe even a playlist. i suggest this because when i personally play for more than a few minutes the music gets somewhat repetitive.
david degraw : beautiful game. it's so satisfying to jump off slope after slope, backfilling and grinding all the way. difficulty level is just right, not too hard, but still challenging. the in app purchases are super minimal, you actually have to go out of your way to find it. there's only one purchasable upgrade, and you definitely don't need it to play the game. overall, i love this game and the execution is perfect!
arukshan : love the one-touch gameplay. would be nice if you could buy more powerups such as higher spawn rate of powerups or a speed powerup. or you could do different types of boards to play with, such as lighter boards for quicker back flips, or a streamlined board for easy build up of speed. along with this you could display their speed and agility in a simple bar, so that we can compare speed and agility with different characters.
jordan miner : with simple mechanics, a simple story, and a wonderful and pleasing art style you will want to witness this game to see just how far you can go and what terrain you see. with challenges you complete to unlock new characters this little app shall be a companion for those with much time to kill and an eye for artistic design.
javier koo : was very skeptical about this game initially, wasn't expecting much from such a mobile game but that changes when i started to play. graphics was pretty good, music was very soothing to the ear as i put on my headphones and it's a different concept from other games. i have been hooked on playing this straight for 30mins and i never got bored. this game is good for user who has to commute on a long journey like me and this got me way addicted. good job developer. keep this up. loving every single play time.
ram gironella : aside from its great choice of art style, the constantly changing background can change the game's atmosphere as well as having new maps every new gameplay leaving the players not experiencing the same thing all over again. the leveling system is also a plus since it is objective rather than relying on numeric scoring system to level up. this is a great and relaxing game for all the ages and even for llamas.
steve mckinnon : great replayability. game run smooth, looks great and is fun to play. perfect level of difficulty, hard enough to challenge most people but not too hard that you can't progress. game is great free but if you want to support the developers you can pay $5 to get a coin multiplier.
william : i don't rate and i typically install and delete games shortly after playing them. this game is by far my favorite game on my phone, i am glad i stumbled across it looking for something to play. good sound, good graphics, fun play. awesome job to the creators, hope to see many great things come to this game.
max moody : a beautiful blend of minimal, 2d and 3d visuals, flowing weather and day and night cycles and a relaxing soundtrack combine to make a truly wonderful experience. and great that it's free and without any pop up ads! my only complaint would be the battery drain...
mellow yellow : great game i think it's fantastic but there are a few issues. the points dont seem to be balanced, like if you do a backflip its the same as collecting one coin. powerups should appear more often because i barely see them. there could be more upgrades for each character to maybe make them flip slightly faster or increase acceleration. sometimes i have to tap something more than once for it to work, like if it says tap to continue. these are only small issues though and the gameplay itself is amazing.
sylvester stephen : i really like this game, the background music is very soothing. i just found one problem that it lags a little. its not a problem but i wish it ran smoother. i use an asus zenfone 2 ze551ml i don't think that it's my phone giving trouble or is it the game.... i genuinely love this game. the graphics are really nice and one of the best side scrolling games i've played, very nice interface too iphone like....
evin jacobs : the graphics of this game are visiually stunning, and it runs smoothly with no hiccups. the controls and mechanics are simple and easy to learn, and there are no pop up ads! very fun, beautiful, and addicting game. i had never taken the time out of my day to rate a mobile game until i played this game. 5 stars all the way.
booboo grisham : the developers of this game did an exceedingly good job. beautiful graphics, satisfying gameplay, it stays fun, and it doesn't abuse the whole freemium pay-to-enjoy thing... it's just a good, honest, and fun game. the character design is fantastic. in fact i almost think it could use a story mode.
saksham sharma : nice game, one issue i faced is that when player is moving with very very high speed, occasionally they'll pass through the coins (especially multicoins) and power ups. also the hover power up is sort of weak as it makes us miss all llamas and coins :c
raphael angoluan : music and graphics are amazing. the game over screen could use slight work with a button to show challenged rather than appear ever so often. stats are cool, wish it was more rewarding than just looking at numbers
ashleigh jones : this game is a piece of art. the snow really flies from under the board, and the music fits perfectly. i think the time changes like in real life. it was light time and rainy, and it was that way in the game! i just began but the mechanics are easy to learn but hard to master. i love this. it's my new favorite game.
maceo raynolds : first off who came up with the idea of chasing llamas down a mountain on a snowboard and dodging and jumping over obstacles... brilliant! at the moment this is my favourite game to just pick up and play. the visuals are stunning, and the music tracks are also very tranquil. it's easy to play which is nice, but also a draw back due to the fact that sometimes i wish i could be more maneuverable. it's well worth it for being free, the minimal art wins me over automatically. it's definitely worth trying out.
benedikt viebahn : nice game with gorgeous graphics. just a few things that bother me. the graphics are awesome, but obstacles are sometimes hard to see. sometimes frames drop very low, especially when going fast. a nexus 5 shouldn't have problems with a sidescroller. but good game overrall
william skinner : best take on an endless runner that i've played in a while. the animation is wonderful, the game play easy to pick up but difficult to master and the music is soothing. it's nice to play a mobile game that isn't just an annoying match 3 cash grab for once. i went ahead and paid the $3.99 for the "coin doubler" not because i needed it, but because i've easily gotten $3.99 worth of entertainment out of this wonderful little game. keep up the good work people :-)
evan danielson : alto's adventure really is a thrilling adventure worth playing over and over again! it seems pretty simple at first with very uncomplex controls, but don't let that steer you clear of this beautiful gem. challenges get more and more difficult the higher you go up in level. and the day/night cycle, the changing environment, the weather, etc all add to the great atmosphere of this game. play it! (bug: if you play for more than a small period of time and a rock ends your game, jumping is disabled on next game)
andreas michaelides : at last a free game that isn't "freemium", even though the game does have in-app purchases it never makes you feel that you need to buy these extra staff to enjoy the game nore dose it force you to use consumables that you need to replenish! and don't get me started on how smooth, fluent and beautiful it is!
nehemiah boscia : this game has a unique, beautiful, but yet simplistic art style. this game's sounds also are very pristine and spot on. as i was listening to the rain sound effect i checked outside to see of it was raining.
megabomb808 : i play this game and its design is amazing it doesn't matter if it looks really nice there are many ways people can look at this but personally for me i think this game is amazing and has a beautiful design. btw if you're like me play roses while playing its amazing. :)
keslong : this game is so simple, beautiful, and most importantly fun. but it would be nice and you could possibly do other tricks on the board. also maybe another thing to use the coins on like different boards or clothes for alto. other than that this game is perfect.
ace byrone halili : normally, i get easily bored and immediately uninstalls every "reach as high as you can" games. this game is an exception. beautiful graphics, simple gameplay and a lot of things that inspire you to keep working. great game
april gilmore : i'm really enjoying this game. it's a great time passer, and helps with my anxiety as well. i love how the graphics are more focused on the environment as opposed to the snowboarders themselves. the ever changing scenery and weather is genius. the music is soothing. this game is truly a work of art. great job!
beau walker : it's just a nice simple game. the only problem i have with it at the moment is that it really heats up my phone
aditya devaguptapu : this game has a similar gameplay mechanic when you compare it with ski safari. but that's about it. but the implementation is simply wonderful - the beautiful backgrounds which dynamically change through night and day as you play, change in scenery from a open landscape to a forest, houses on the slopes and a lot of incredible detail in the tiny things - like flags falling off and floating lanterns in the sky. i could go on about how this is the most beautiful game i've seen on a handheld...
lynsey b : noodlecake have pulled another beautiful game out of their hat. the music and visuals are just beautiful, the game has just the right learning curve, and snowboarding through the scenery is incredibly relaxing. there's no nagging about iaps which is refreshing, but i would happily pay actual money to never have to see that wordup ad again! i'll pay for an ad-free unlock. edit: noticed a bug, after a while the game seems to stop registering input (level 33)
kingballoon : alto is an awesome game with simple but beautiful artstyle, and i enjoy it a lot. however, i do think a few changes should be made to the game in order to make it better. first, i think you should put more coins on grind spots. i sometimes find myself forced to choose, keep my trick combo going, or get those coins on the ground. secondly, tweak paz's description a bit. it implies that if paz goes fast enough, he can break through rocks. i spent a few minutes trying to ram rocks and, it didn't work out ^.^u
ian melvin : while there have been many other games that have thrived off of a similar concept to alto's adventure, what sets this game apart is the fantastic art, attention to detail, and super smooth and solid gameplay. fantastic game for a fantastic price. free.
josh duncan : absolutely stunning, mesmerizing. the developers have done an incredible job. highly urge the developers to not stop updating, adding features or improving this game.
aslan wilder : i enjoy this game a lot, but sometimes tapping my screen to jump doesn't work at all and it's driving me crazy. x- ( worst thing is that it happens exactly when i feel determined to beat a challenge. it's so frustrating. i play it on a galaxy s6. congrats for the wonderful game you made, though.
phil coffin : i have been looking for a game like this for a while. simple in concept yet challenging. i like that the down hill course changes every time.
daedrian domingo : i can really tell this game has taken a lot of effort and work to make. from the graphics and performance, it is just magnificient and really eye - catching. the graphics are breathtaking and taken from a whole new level. from that, i mean this runner game is just completely different from the others like the popular temple run, subway surfers, and minion rush. the game itself has a great storyline and once you acquire the wingsuit, it just feels more amazing than ever before. to be honest, i like this game and for the first time have i ever played a snowboarding runner game. i'm glad that the updates always fix the bugs as soon as possible which keeps the ratings as excellent as it could be. out of all, i would really rate this game 10/5 based on the graphics, potential, performance, detail, content, and effort it has really put into. the people who created this game, you guys are just great and you deserve an award. :)
gaurav shukla : one of d finest game. need to add more tricks....back flip is interesting but at d other end boring also as single trick present in game
tyler andrews : i have not played the game yet but the preview video was absolutely phenomenal. just for that single reason, this game deserves 5 stars.
john trout : very simplistic but it is still a very beautiful game. it's not hard but it's not easy either which i think gives it that perfect balance.
zackchibi tail : omg i love this game so much it really help me give out my anger when i'm stressed; )
lucas beach : i absaloutely love everything about this game! however only one slight thing i would change would be the coin placement so that when you go on the rails you can collect them there as well as on the ground. one other thing that is not needed as much but would be a good idea is to have powerups that you can buy and use, for example a speed boost for when you are being chased by an elder.
shawn : this game is really fun and i love the design, colors, and music of the game. those three things make the game pretty calming and aesthetically enjoyable. the games challenges progress and get harder but not to the point where you find yourself getting mad that you can't pass them. great game!
goddard a-mortty : it's not even the game i fell in love with. i love the ui, very well designed. no ads bugged me, the game was no let down either. this is how you create an app. well done!
gaetan lecherbourg : because it didn't work on my asus zenfone 2. but now after a few days the developper released an update especially for this phone, now the game's doing fine! that's a nice kind of support, 5 star quality! the game's also nice and funny too, with nice graphics and an original story.
jakub zurawski : one touch play, like the backflipping thing veeeery much plus the graphic is just great! oh, and the combos. always trying to do better one
chirayu giri : fantastic ,unobtrusive and the only time that ads are shown is when you yourself choose to watch them for coins.
bert t : i never rate games however this has blown my mind. this is what a game should be. the music is perfect, the visuals are perfect, the gameplay is perfect. i cannot name a better game
7shivam1 _ : beautiful ui and game design. lots of tricks to learn and endless gameplay. alto's adventure is an amazing time killer.
izayah duncan : did u know i was the first person to have this game as soon as i saw it on the home screen i down loaded it but try it. its fun
terence p : this game is absolutely stunning. originally i thought it would be more like the lower quality games, but after spending quite a lot of time playing it, this game exceeded my expectations. i would recommend this game to anyone.
pierce s : everyone should download it. great developer was quick to update for intel users. game is fantastic just as it was on ios. love this game. download it now and you won't be sorry.
rainbow trout : a masterpiece of human ingenuity. i can not wait to see what the future of this game will uphold.
henry tf : all fixed! devs fixed the bug within two updates. it's a beautiful game that's deceptively simple. the game worked great before the previous update. now it shows the logo, then just a black screen. this is on an asus zenfone 2
prayudi a. : and this game proves that fancy graphics doesn't always mean business.
gourav bhattacharaya : the aesthetic graphics are truly awesome, there lies a serenity in the gameplay, even the game hud are aesthetically designed .
manish amgain : i reconfigured the pause button from left to right because it hurts my right thumb... you might have guessed how additive this game is... the only advice ia please make the obstacles more visible at night.
luke young : this small game is clearly a winner... the graphics are stunning, the music is beautiful and the atmospheric sounds are more than satisfyingly exquisite.
richard johnston : a re-imagined yet side scroller feel of the windows 95 game ski free with todays visuals. very fun to play.
tez padhee : loved the relaxing music, the stunning visuals and the idea to keep it non pay to win game.
nathaniel graham : extremely fun game, one of the best mobile games i've played. the game is very beautiful with great sound effects. my only gripe is the coin system seems to be a little half baked.
logan hunt : as someone who has never heard of snowboarding, this has really opened my eyes to the world of winter sports. i just hope this is an exact representation of snowboarding.
alex scaffo : thus game is gorgeous, simplistic yes. maybe even can get boring overtime. but it's free and beautiful. the lighting dynamic at night is aesthetically pleasing and the music compliments it so well
jorge salceda : beautiful graphics and beautiful ost. also doesn't attack you with annoying ads. but you can watch some to continue playing.
jacob smith : i love the simplicity, art style, feel characters, and the mechanics. i haven't seen a single glitch, and i can't wait for future updates and games from snowman. awesome job!
ibrahim chelanga : every time my day goes well or bad this game never fails to disappoint in making you happy... pls make more
joshua townsend : the game is fun, the goals are not grindy, and the best part is no microtransactions. the fact that you can add in game currency via watching commercials instead of paying for it is amazing.
garrett saucedo : the music and setting are really relaxing. it also looks great. the game is fun especially if you like endless runners.
madi khayyat : briliant game in every aspect, more flips, booster and weather conditions could be added though but still a pretty good game
rly rly rly : to me, it is the best and beautiful game on android i've ever played. well done devs. keep up the good work
adam malbon : i don't see nothing wrong with a little bunting grind.
bryan loo : unlike most endless games, this is flawlessly executed and well done. i've never been a fan of the genre, but this game is soothing and doesn't require much dexterity. something young and old can enjoy!
chris strangemore : this is a beautifully designed game with some nice differences from other endless runner games. the level goals are challenging without being impossible and i really like the addition of doing the snowboarding tricks.
christopher williams : i just reached level 41. now no can play as the lama witch has a cool ability that gives him a double jump witch gives me a good trick combo score .
paul kaller : stunning light effects and picturesque layout. easy to use and only one finger needed to control snowboarder. it's a beautiful game.
ashley june : great graphics amazing gameplay endless runner goals to complete amazing music multiple skins to unlock best graphics i've seen on a phone and best unless runner game i've seen as well
ivan samuelson : addicting, challenging, fun. a different take on the endless runner concept. no invasive ads and you really don't have to purchase the iaps to fully enjoy the game. definitely worth a look if you love the endless runner games.
a google user : it is literally the perfect game. it was the only one i had on my phone for a very long time but i mamaged to complete it eventually with much satisfaction. the best game that i have played so far
mr darwen : a game that's free, that's enjoyable and without adds popping up! you don't have to pay a penny and for that you receive a mobile game that's beautiful, addictive and unique to the otherwise boring 'free run' type games from the past. well done noddlecake games!
minnie w : i think this is an awesome game,the graphics are stunning and it is really well thought out. it is annoying when there is a huge chasm that you cant cross though!
shawn mcfadden : on my lg phone when in the pause menu the screen is bigger than my phone so parts of the menus are cut off.
james turner : there no pretenses or gimmicks it's even a bit relaxing. i'm not even mad when i bail on a flip...it's just one beautifully made game

sophie t.b : loved this game, it has amazing graphics and can be calming. i would recommend this to anyone!

matt r. : so happy this is now on android. not a huge fan of the ads but they aren't intrusive.

eminem : add disaster challenges the disaster will make meteor at get down from the mountain (faster),make multiplayer,make campaign,make armor for lives,and skater for speed,so this game will changed to adventures,make more trick too!! please update for this and all commenters to change this game to they dream game :v
zach mccullough : it's simple, fun, and challenging. can be frustrating at times though lol

kayla dolese : i love it but, had to uninstall it and was not able to back it up by signing into my google play acc.

richard lewis : i really like the game but my progress shows in google play but not in the app so i have to start again.
ross2k : its so incredible the gameplay outshines the bugs, one thing though, if you could add some sort of non-competative online multiplayer? and possibly different snowboard available for purchase? otherwise, you are golden!

amanda burroughs : love it. game play continues to challenge 10 hours in, good variety and noticeable difference between characters. addicting, fun, just great overall.

jared vandermeulen : this game is beautiful, smooth, and addicting. no ads just a great time.

robert patrick hernandez : good gameplay. good sound. good grafix. great adventure. plus, instead of the annoying ads that destroy most games this gem actually let's you use the ads to keep your progress. this is how all games should be made. kudos to the developer. great job!
reece brown : i love this game. currently working as a lifty on a ski resort and this passes the time by perfectly. it's simple, addictive and beautifully designed with an affective back drop. one suggestion though would be possible bonus levels every now and then for the chance to collect extra coins or maybe something new. other than that, great job!
raphael daya : i loved all of it. it would be more awesome if the game was more story-like. not the fancy "temple run style". it is called 'adventure' for a reason devs. put some more story into that game! :)
jeremy buchsbaum : it's a fantastic endless runner. beautiful minimalist visuals; sick music; creative, refreshing, and smooth ui; and addictive gameplay. what more could you want? except maybe more characters...

cthulhu : i love it, you should add a halloween theme, like halloween mode and christmas mode, it would be nice :d
leslie david : this is an outstanding game being that it's only an arcade like game. the ambiance is great, it has soothing music and great graphics if possible this desserves a 6 star review

rev. raju cheeran : it's superbbb
derrick ross : ok-ish
michael guerra : this game is great. it is visually appealing. i enjoy the music. the sound effects of the boarder are realistic and make me miss snowboarding. i have one suggestion. if a player crashes right before a jump/chasm, and chooses to continue from that spot, there is no forgiveness. 100% of the time the player will plummet into the chasm at the start. this should be fixed so that the player actually gets a fair continue.
jc cc : i seen this game i thought it looked like a game i might like it.i was right it's a fun game and addicting i started yesterday and now i can't stop playing the game it is so awesome the noodlecake games the information also play more of your games i stared the day before i wrote this and i've been playing since and yall people who think this is a good game you are write so please get it its a so amazing it's good to which the trailer first
bhargav emani : best game ever in sky diving sport. it's not just like sky diving.. music gives u a pleasure to play more.. levels and goals are fun to complete them. good graphics. clean interface. glad to be one of the first few downloaded people of this game it took me time to review this. good game .
a google user : it's very rare that you come across a game that is simple, challenging, and visually beautiful. alto's adventure is all three of these things. very easy to pick up and play, with a wide field for skilled players to improve on their previous plays and increase scores, and on top of all this the visuals are stunning. i would highly recommend this game to anyone.
mirko gradski : it's almost relaxing to play this. just watch out for rocks. easy on the eyes and very soft background music put the finishing touches on presentation for this one. like a minimal robot unicorn but not nearly as fast paced. will pay for a full version/final version of there is one. i'm using a moto x pure.
dustin henning : i love the game, fun and simple with amazing art direction. i have a few minor complaints though. if the workshop and character selects could have links from the post run screen, that would be nice. and maybe i missed it but at first i had no clue what the coins were for because the workshop was so hard to find. besides that i love how the ads are totally optional and out of the way, and that there really isn't any expensive premium content. so far i've played about 4 hours of this game and am loving it.
chris k : this is a superb endless runner (well ski-er) with all you would want. nice visuals, achievable challenges and new characters that are unlocked without paying. in-app not at all needed unless you want to double your coins or buy coins that can be earned. seriously worth giving it a go. i have been hooked!
christopher willis : i don't like endless runners but something about this game is different. maybe it's the wondrous music. or perhaps it's that there are other little goals to attain rather than just a high score. and the setting is relaxing and beautiful all at once. whatever it is, i'm hooked.
malve akhil sharan : everything part of this game is beautiful. those day night transitions and the weather changes are breath taking. music, well it gives this game life. sorry i never looked deep into the gameplay because the other aspects kept me going on.
amit patel : i cannot give this game enough praise: fluid and enjoyable gameplay, superb soundtrack, amazing environment and i adore the whole day/night cycle - such a clever addition. this is honestly one of the best things i've ever downloaded - credit to the team at noodlecake for putting together something truly special.
medusa yuk : i don't review games often and i'm not a massive fan of one-touch gaming but i had to leave a comment here because this game is pretty close to being perfect. the controls (tap to jump, hold to flip) are good, it has a gorgeous visual aesthetic, beautiful musical accompaniment, and absolutely nails the 'just one more go' thing. there's enough to do in terms of game progression etc to keep you coming back for more. there's no intrusive or aggressive purchase demands. it's a lovely, lovely game and it deserves your attention. highly recommended.
eto gabashvili : i played this on ipad a lot and been waiting for a long time to have it on android. i love the visual style and it's very hard to put it down and stop playing. i like that it's free, the ads don't bother me at all. it's been a few days and i unlocked all the characters and saved up enough coins for future content!
shaun siau : a great game with gorgeous design language that is just amazing. controls are simple (tapping and holding) and movement is very fluid. glad that the android version is finally here, and there is no visible lag or annoying ads (other than those you choose to view). amazing implementation!
tubz inator : this is a really good game. i think there could be more to it but i could wait. i think there should be a multiplayer mode were u can race against others and bet on who gets 1st, 2nd, or 3rd out of a four person race. it could go up to like 100 max coins to bet. there could also be perks in the game like a higher jump or lives per game/percentage chance of being able to go again without watching a video or paying. other than that great game.
gwyn d'mello : simple enough in concept, with the real edge being in the beautiful animation for the levels and the music with it. not to mention this is the first smartphone game i've seen with dynamic weather patterns and day/night cycle, that even carries over into the menu screen. love!
uknown uknown : atmospheric, addictive, and mesmerizing as you play an endless running skier. provides relaxation and a small challenge. only ads i've seen so far has been connected with respawning the skier at a prior place. controls and music are stellar. been waiting for this game ever since the apple release!
jordan skiver : i normally hate mobile games and don't enjoy them at all. usually they are unoriginal and lack any fun factor at all. though the concept of this game is not original. the art style is and the fact the game doesn't really require you to make micro transactions which is awesome. best mobile game out there in my opinion. i can't put it down.
brenden young : i absolutely love this game. it's beautiful graphics and one touch game play keep me hooked and coming back for more. please have constant updates and add-ons. my only complaint is it seems almost impossible most times to escape an elder purely from speed.
a v : i like these genres and this one is very well made except the challenges to lvl up i wish they gave you money and also more power ups would be good and last but not least more types of obstacles would be nice, i hope you improve the game in other ways and keep doing a good job.
i am groot : the moment i started playing this game i fell in love with it. it is so simple yet so beautiful, it's artistic, amusing, relaxing, enjoyable, great, and i can't believe it completely free! the soundtrack is beautiful and the sound effects are brilliant, especially the thunders. when i put my headphones on i thought it was raining outside until i figured the sound was coming from the game. thanks so much for this beautiful game!
andrei lipoczi : everything about it. music atmosphere design. its... amazing. honestly the best endless runner out there. the only thing i don't like is the type of ads used. they're a bit obnoxious, and ruin the atmosphere if i choose to watch one, but i guess the devs can't control everything. 5 stars, love it.
dave colgate : more games need to be like this. no invasive adverts, stunning musical score, breathtaking artwork and easy, addictive game play. great game and difficult to put down. the objectives are challenging but not impossible which provides a positive sense of progress. something many games miss completely.
luke iles : fun game with great graphics and smooth gameplay, but not much to do other than admire the scenery while grabbing coins... a suggestion would be to link the number of llamas you catch to something other than points; possibly coins or future collectibles/upgrades. additional obstacles and unlockables/upgrades along with new soundtracks for different atmospheres would significantly increase enjoyment as well! still, one of the absolute best casual games i've played!
maximiliano vique : really addicting, doesn't shove ads down my throat after every play. the only time they show ads is if you want to earn extra coins. game is entertaining and has lots of challenges to keep you occupied.
ian gray : on my sgs6. seems to be less mainstream devices having issues. keep it installed and wait for updates. it reminds me of a ton of other ski games but very smooth game play and modern graphics. simple controls make this fun to play and hard to put down.
hunter crowton : this game is wonderful. the graphics are simple but gorgeous. the gameplay is easy and fun. the whole atmosphere, from lamas to snow boarding down a mountain is amazing. this game is just wonderful! if i had any complaints, i would ask for a skier option and maybe a flashlight for night, but that's it. spectacular job!
piyush chandrakar : i rarely rate any app or game but i must say this is the best game i ever found in play store.. developers its a request please keep it free of any charges and ads.. newbie can play and master it....
stance of dance : this game is extremely fun and its downloads have shot up, since i had saw a recommendation of the brand new game and being the first in the first thousand to download it i still have it and love the relaxation and graphics of it too. :-)
a google user : this is the first game i've wanted to go out of my way to rate, and i don't normally rate anything. the simplicity of this game and general structuring is very well executed, and there are no ads! which is a big thing these days and its free, you don't even need to purchase any in game upgrades to be able to have mass amounts of enjoyment out of this, i believe this game is on its way to become viral if this game is practically left as it is. please don't ever put ads on this game or its a 1>5
orlando shim-hue : so relaxing love the change of weather. when i pause the game its actually relaxing to listen to the rain. graphics are clean and smooth. really enjoy playing this. and love how the scene/ track is not always predictable. sometimes i hit the rocks because i'm paying attention to the scenery :-) i have a nexus 7 2013 btw works well on it no issues at all.
katja : i've played this game before and i loved it so much, but now when i downloaded it in my own phone, i experienced some difficulties. first of all, it is impossible to pass the first level because of the chasm. it is too long and there is no way to jump over it. next, i am unable to access the store on the first level, so i am unable to try to upgrade anything. enabling people to use the store might make it easier to complete the chasm jump. other than those two problems, this is an amazing game.
enrique rodriguez : everything is good for me on this game. one thing that sometimes goes wrong though is the background song. it's seems to repeat itself on one part making it sound as if it were a scratched disk or something. it fixes afer restarting but that is only periodical.
k. bae : i love the simple art style like monument valley that makes me want to keep playing if only to stop and look at the artwork. it's a rare kind of infinite runner, one that makes you want to keep playing, to never leave the serene lands.
matoro zeliph : this is pretty much ski safari bare bones. however it makes up for it by having a dynamic weather/day-night cycle. here is hoping there can be more types of mountains to ski on, more dynamic soundtrack and probably a sequel! awesome relaxing game!
thespore35 : oh. my. god. those were the words i murmured to myself when the game melted itself on the screen. the graphics and scenery are some of the best and most gorgeous i've never seen in gaming history, be it pc or console. instantly this reminded me of the game journey, where the style and beauty embedded in the background tells a remarkable tale. i love the simple but mind numbly fun gameplay while watching the hours go by, as well as the addicting side quests done during your journey. simply amazing!
nathan pratt : hi, i read about this game on ios last year and am very happy to be able to play on my android phone, but i'd really appreciate it if you could add an option to disable the video ad choice inside the game. i watched a few to revive alto and they aren't exactly kid-safe. i cannot in good conscience recommend this game as is to my nephews for example as the "kill shot: bravo" video ad that they might see has a bullet going through a guy's skull in slo-mo. i'd pay iap to prevent them from having that option.
muntazar jafree : love this game. looks beautiful on my moto x style. music is awesome. the weather effects in this game is the best ever. the way how you earn your characters and the day-to-night transition is cool. addicted to a mobile game after a long while.
gooblemikehawk : loved every part of it and there weren't any random pop up ads. i would recommend adding a few more tricks. like being able to swipe and then being able to make chained tricks like front flips special grinds and such. amazing game anyway!
just relax : i like that the ski run is different when you have to start over. the music, sound effects and graphics are great. enjoy watching the scenery change from day to night. some reason the graphics remind me of the game journey from thatgamecompany on ps3.
justalex : beautiful graphics. beautiful music. just one problem. i seem to be having a notification that's at the bottom of my screen all the time telling me that i have to achieve 500m in one run even though i do. apart from this its awesome. okay so it turns out i just needed to restart my game so it's gone now.
chris fitzgerald : it's a little bit of a ripoff of ski safari, but the art in this one is very awesome and the gameplay is just as good or better.
gerry heidenreich : i would love to see more social features, like playing friends levels with ghosts, and compare stats and hi scores.
eddie cockerell : really ambient & well put together. i've already sunk a few hours into it. one tiny thing - maybe the night scenes could be a little brighter? it might just be me, but i feel like i can't see anything when it's not daytime in the game. anyway, love it!
sidney hemphill : i love a game that doesn't revolve around a shooting mechanic. the great sound designed, simple art style, and gameplay of alto's adventure trumps many of the big budget home console games out there.
poppy daniels : only problem i have is the character selection... i'm level 36 and maya (2nd character you get) is the only good one so far... you need to do tricks to build speed up and the others backflip far to slow.
reece jackson : i love this game! me when alto falls down a massive gorge: oh alto probably found his way out. what really happened: alto spent three days in a gorge and was forced to eat his last llama until he eventually died from frostbite, this has been fox news, signing out. lol
idlepeace : the backgrounds are awsome. the app guides you well enough to get things started in an interesting way.. try this guys.. well done.
jones naylor : this game has amazing graphics and soundtrack. controls are easy to use and fun try more risk stuff like back flipping off a crevis onto a rock slide on a flag line then nose dive on a llama.
thomas c. : this game is beautiful, simple, and fun. i love surfing down the snow-covered slopes as the sun sets, through quaint villages and majestic woodery, on my one-man mission to murder all the loosed llamas.
matthew curley : i like how u can get a better character when you finish a few missions and how you can buy stuff in the shop but i don't like how the coin doubler scarf is real money and i would be great full if you could change it to the money you collect in the game ;-)
prasad vandavasi : game has it all. easy to begin and control , good ramping of skills, beautiful graphic style, environmental effects, very engaging yet relaxing, procedural replay ability. kudos to the devs. truly good games on a mobile platform are a rarity.
dante ele : i love the materialistic design of the game. suits with the android theme. more games of this graphics should be made. good job developers
saurav sahay : well i dnt write reviews vry often fr ny app or game bt ths one just got my heart. i have played games to win or loose in boredom or time pass bt ths one is different. this game is actually quite soothng nd gves a strange kind of happiness nd peace specially the background music, i luv the music nd the scene seems as if its a cold winter fairy tale...awsme guys jist luvd it!!!
john o : very few mobile games keeps my attention but i can't put this game down. beautiful music and art style, any chance i can get a sound track? the game has a soothing effect on me. one side thing tho, can we get more options for tricks?
john varghese : one of the best games that i have played so far in android... the controls especially jus one button, difficulty levels. graphics everything is excellent.only thing im feeling bad s the wather changes very quickly.. the animation is good. fantastic work harry,jordan,ryan,kpow,brian andrew & ur team...keep it up!
adrien samson : i haven't played much to be honest, but from what i've seen this is a very promising game. it's simple to understand how the game works. i look forward to playing some more.
minh nguyen : the slow motion when performing backflips, the background music and specially the weather effects,.. all of them are really amazing! but the game could be better if you add somethings like 'perfect landing' or another boost. anyway i love this game.
james fellows : great game that deserves more downloads. i love the music and graphics and simple gameplay. don't stop doing what you're doing!
wierdo hehe : when i go to the settings page it's all out of place i can barely go back to the home screen please fix
tajuddin shaikh : the visuals are just wow. it makes me actually want to get inside the game and live there. the gameplay has nothing novel but the picturesque backdrop makes up for it.
jolie klein : it's beautiful yet simplistic, the goal is unique, it's so fun to play and very relaxing and the music is beautiful as well. i honestly, truly, love this game.
trevon hayes : i first played this game on an ipad at an apple store and i was sooooooooo sad that it wasn't available for android but i'm glad that it's finally here. i love it so much. great game.
bistok diiel lelono : instead of adding new things to this kind of game, the developer chose to give different experience by using soothing music, artsy background, and less type of power up.
kev : great game so far, i can't get enough. the soundtrack and graphics are stunning and the game play is difficult enough to keep me interested..i love it
adam faiana amru : since i found it in ios appstore, i always wanted this game and damn right i wasn't disappointed. night skiing at its best.

wesleech : an option for day/night would be nice. kind of hard to see at night with glare in normal lighting. other than that good stuff.
vamsi krishna : beautiful graphics and simple gameplay. really enjoyed playing it. could add more to make it enjoyable without too much bloatware but still excellent. don't add any useless distracting gameplay features. simple and beautiful
steven vanmaele : amazing sound design, the changing challenges keep it fresh, gorgeous visuals that don't get old. in love with this game
marc collazo : would be awesome if you can have the choice to pick the time of day. if i want to play a endless night/day/rain i can choose it. other then that this game is very addicting.

cee bee : i don't know what it is about this game, but has a certain charm that keeps me hooked. it's probably the art style and scenery that amazes me, or probably the concept, but whatever it is... its extraordinary.
jatheen kumar : this game is the most beautiful game i've played on my phone and it is also very calm and relaxing. i just wish that you could buy new things for alto like a new hat or new snowboard. but everything else is wonderful.
raf malinski : work fine on my galaxy s5. if it doesn't work on your phone get a better phone. this game is amazing.
thebongchronicle : one of the best graphics game i wave ever played try it at night in ur bed u wll be in dffrnt zone

brandon hayes : it's really good game. no issues so far. just gets a little to dark and difficult to see the rocks sometimes cause it's behind stuff. that's one of the few issues that should be fixed
poly : unobtrusive ads and beautiful graphics. my only suggestions would be repeating goals for those really long runs, and a track editor for community built runs and challenges.
tanay sharma : okay, have to admit : the graphics are gorgeous! gameplay is fantastic and even the soundtrack.

a google user : one of the best games ever.
the alpha : i love this game... best snow advntr ever...
zach albin : this game is very fun right off the bat and becomes even more fun as you get better at it. i find that it can be played a lot and never get old. the available in-game upgrades and addicting game play make this title playable over and over again. honestly surprised that the game is free, well worth a download.
mohamed farag : the game is simple and addictive, that's an easy feat nowadays. but what's not is that the game is so elegantly designed that i lose my focus on playing it and get carried away with looking at the graphics. everything is well designed; the main menu, the pause menu, the submenus, the game itself... etc. it is so rare to find a game or an app with so much effort spent on design. well done! hope to see other developers following suit.
a google user : i don't always commend devs for how they put advertisements into their apps but the option to revive the player once by paying coins you earn pretty quickly in game or to watch a 30 second video is very natural and tasteful. simple yet fun and beautiful this is a great game. edited my rating to reflect my true opinion on this game. one of the first games i've found myself wanted to play more than once or twice. beautiful, peaceful visuals, pretty soundtrack and easy to learn, hard to master gameplay.
unknown unknown : this game did ski safari 1 did (not 2. ski safari 2 is complete garbage with terrible art) and makes it better with great art work, ui, mechanics, and more. not only that but the game is optimized flawlessly and the game just came out. this game deserve 5/5 hands down.
andrew cobain : very enjoyable game. great graphics and sound. downloaded to my experience z and played no problem. unfortunately wouldn't get past loading screen and a short piece of music before freezing on my hudl 2. gutted i couldn't play it on a larger screen and hope there's a fix soon!
nikandr marhal : oh, i've been waiting for it on the android since played it for the first time a year ago. the experience is unforgettable and joyful. can't stop playing for hours. special respect to brian crawford and harry nesbitt for the music and the picture! thank you for such a beautiful and delightful game! p.s. became world top-1 just entered
fabester king : i just got this game a few mins ago and once i opened it, it gave me a very helpful tutorial and gave me a chance to listen to the relaxing music as well. this is a great game to pass away the time stress-free
anthony lupow : combining this and the beautiful graphic design to look at, this is one of the best free games to this day. but there are no miracles, thus the game doesn't feature any complex gameplay mechanics, which is unfortunate.
lofi nomad : just got this game have and have seen no adverts or nothing in the way that helps me identify why this game is free. i feel like i should have paid money. or maybe it's somehow linked to my bank account and is taking money from me, if so go ahead, you guys deserve it!!! it really is a great game, very simple and not a new idea but it does what it sets out to do and does it the best i have seen. i think it is the attention to detail and how it changes weather and also day and night. the art style is so charming that you want to be there, hop of your board and admire the scenery. somehow i feel i should do my bit and hand out leaflets promoting the game in my free time. get it people it is awesome. peace
kaotek kowbell : can not stop playing! from the beautifully rendered artwork to the simple tap screen controls, this game is well worth the download. a great game for killing time as each level only has three goals and shouldn't take you long to complete. love the day/night cycle giving the game some diversity in appearance. love winning a new character every ten levels. love the whimsical background music. love the exciting elder chases. love this game! recommended to all!!!
justin mittel : seriously, in the looks, music, and gameplay is nothing but pure style. to start off, this game looks beautiful. it has a day/night cycle and even a weather cycle that will put you through rain and snow. the sounds and music of the game are very fitting and really help set the feel for this game. the way it controls is super easy to pick up and you'll be flipping up huge combos in no time, and slomo backflips over chasms is really a nice boost to that "hell yeah!" feeling.
ridzuan osman : very beautiful graphic in addition of time changing from dust to dawn. nice gameplay and concept with soothing soundtrack. recommended to all
david browne : didn't have high expectations as i thought it was going to be a ski safari rip off. although it is similar in many ways, this is a much better experience - the graphics, sound and simple game play are very rewarding. i've noticed a few complaints about the monetization in the game but this isn't really an issue - if you don't want to pay for double coins, then just save coins in-game. other complaints about having to watch a video for a retry are irrelevant - just get good!
mark holland : ive been waiting for this since loving it on the ipad for over a year!! and after all the nagging at them on facebook it's finally here... and totally worth the wait. looks super crisp on my xperia z3. for the people complaining about the videos for retries - you dont need to watch these, and can retry in the same way as you can on ios. really impressed that this is as free as it is, and i'll be buying in app purchases just to support the devs so so happy this is finally here and we'll worth the wait!
dan rubin : very fun game. a good time waster while on the train. audio and visual just stunning. all in all, i like it.
erin d : i don't even really like endless runners, but this game is just good. it's beautiful, it's various, and it's pleasant to play, which i can't say for a whole lot of these mobile games. very well done and certainly worth your time.
jacob brown : i've been waiting for this to come to android. this is a fun game with very nice graphic art style. i just wish there was a paid version with no ads. i hate ads but i like to pay devs for their time and effort making a good game.
kyle hall : wasn't to impressed at first after playing ski safari, much different mechanics, but once i got into it and trying to complete the tasks it grew on me, wonderful graphics, tip: turn brightness up for night time it helps, i beat the game in two weeks casually playing it, tho i see others want cloud save and i'd agree all games should have that, never know when a phone may break or whatever and you don't want to start over
jezy v : its really fun. it barely lags at all so its good on my phone. a job well done.
kevin starnes : this game will be the next big hit. trust me. it wil have a million downloads in no time.it's just awesome. download it now
jacob seifert : i'm sceptical with the genre though and the pricing model here is also questionable, forcing players to view ads even if they've bought the iap. give it a try and see if it suits your taste or not.
darshan suratwala : be quick to launch the game on android because android user are numerous in number which will be good for revenue.
lucaskywalker music : this game is very beautiful with the best graphics i've seen! there is weather change and music. i just think you could add more things to buy, like more landscapes for example. but not even a minor problem with the game itself!! stunning!
osaretin obadeyi : i haven't had a game feel this fun in a while this game is seriously good the only downside is it takes up battery life like nobody's business
devon pollard : so nice to see this game finally come to android i've heard so many great things about this game from my ios friends
jordan mays : i have no clue what it is about this game, maybe the graphics, or the music, or the simple controls, or maybe the long day and night cycle, but this is one of the best games i have ever played on mobile
giovanni delgado : the music is calming and the scenery is just outstanding. i love how it always changes to different weather conditions, making it worth to play. 5/5 stars.
the codfather : looks great, plays pretty well, and good difficulty - overall excellent fun and the best endless runner i've come across
killer kristov : i highly recommend this game. however, having an option to turn off the night cycle would be great. when playing on the bus, the (real life) sun makes it too hard to see, even at max brightness.
ethan lugbauer : beautiful art design, stunning visuals and wonderful gameplay and controls...highly recommended just an overall well made fantastic game..
fabian irimiea : back on ios this game took away hours of my life, really fun, never boring and incredible design, i have not been this happy in a while! time to catch llama's
peedi piper : this game gets a pass because i love how the weather changes as you playing the game and the music is brilliant.
sam the boi : this is great game if you're in to catching lamas, busting through rocks, doing back flips i mean c'mon man get this game
nathan prewett : i appreciate that it asks me to sign into google games, not forces me to. the game is fun, challenging, relaxing and often exciting. the visuals are nice and the music is enjoyable. good simple fun for anyone.
james zander : simple and cute,love to play it. really so relaxing my mind. still am using old update. no problem in my note3. everything is perfect
baby yoda : i like evrything about alto and llamos like the graphics,the gameplay etc. i have also been looking for a good game on the app store but so far alto and the llamas is the best one i found
ahmad azri : beautiful ui, beautiful game and the best thing is no annoying ads. hope you guys can keep it this way forever.
paul love : great game, little bugs on my phone at least, like small flashes in the bottom right corner when i jump sometimes (htc desire 820)
irfaan chundoo : for me,this game is one of my best games.cause,you are alto and you are gliding on a snowy mountain,there are rainstorms,snow and also hunters.it is more relaxing to play in a rainy day for me as it makes me think of my best moments
barry white : i have been waiting for the android port for months, lovely game. purchased the doubler to support you guys. don't tar all android users with the same brush, we are not all dirty pirates.
taylor martin : this is not only an amazing game, it's also a work of art.
liber : kept me wanting to advance, just so i could see more of the game's envoirnment and background.
trambak ray : not only its fun, its surprisingly beautiful and stunning. amazing work and keep it up devs.
luke stoelinga : everything a mobile game should be: simple and yet complex, goals goals to keep you interested, and no annoying adds
ham : just excellent graphics, very pleasing on the eyes. it would be much nicer with some sort of progression or upgrades but still a very good game.
daniel griffiths : with breathtakingly beautiful backdrops that are simply stunningly, this easy-to-pickup but too-playable-to-put-down game will be a big hit on android and fantastic for tablet users.
matthew bilodeau : not required to spend money to play. can play offline, no network connection needed. excellent graphics, addictive and fun.
er : this is so hard to put down! a great and simple game with an amazing art style, i love this addiction!
nazo 45 : this game probably has the best looking and most simple game i've downloaded. good job to the developers
jessi sch. : this is probably the prettiest game i've ever played. the music is great and atmospheric, the llamas are cute as heck and its just a really gorgeous game. and what make me even happier, there are no ads at all. just amazing, love it.
jason dolan : plays great on the nvidia shield android tv. it is so addictive.. the only issue's i'm see is that the leanback-launcher icon is the stock unity icon. also some of the on-screen commands reference touch controls. it would take very little to make this a polished game for android tv.
doogel altner : this game is one of those beautifully crafted games with great music and great challenges, love it, keep em coming
gavin penfold : endless runners can have a hard time being original, however, this one puts a new twist on a very common genre. it's very fun, and challenging enough to keep you entertained.
m binderup : i can play just fine. it has to be your tablets. i have a four year old tablet and it works fine. great game btw
logan bixby : i'm not a huge fan of endless runners but this is one of my favorite games, i think what attracts me is the graphics and snow boarding theme, great game i love it.
toby verdaguer : the game looks awesome! i just really hate that my screen goes black after showing "alto's adventure". i just really wish i could play the game. phone:galaxy s4
crnk snart : so freaking addictive i suggest this game to people that likes video games because this is something i have never seen before.
adrien r. : this game is probably one of the best of the entire play store . it has gorgeous graphics , soothing music a simple gameplay and an awesome feel . so , you're a snowboarder , alto , and your llamas have escaped . you then engage in a "quest" to go save them all !

adam simmonds : absolute gorgeous art style, fun gameplay, beautiful music. it's nice to see the developer treat the android ecosystem differently than the iso one too. beautiful game and deffiently worth downloading.
tyrone ong : great game and quite addictive. love the graphic too. but one question: do birds rest on the ground when it's raining? maybe it's just design, and yeah, i'm not taking this too seriously.
meghal s. : beautiful, seamless, and looks excellent. hopefully other features will be added in further updates, this game should be on top!

sam gemmet : alto's adventure has been a favorite of mine since it came out on ios. it's a very beautiful game and one that i could play for hours. i was concerned when i heard it would be free on android and supported by ads, but they are very well done and you could play the whole game without watching or being bothered by a single one. noodlecake did an excellent job porting this game.

maxime lebrun : what a sumptuous game, good to see this kind of really well build design. the music is as lovely as the picture is. the over all atmosphere is really calm and nostalgic, probably because of the variations of the background too. the gameplay is easy and get more interesting over the time. 5 stars well deserved imo

dianne consolacion : perfect game to play in short bursts. extremely polished in terms of visuals, sounds and gameplay. stands out in a saturated market of infinite runners.

suhan s : this is the kinda game that brings out the beauty of the screens of higher end phones like the galaxy s6. absolutely worth it
debanjan paul : aesthetically pleasing. besides that, fairly easy gameplay. it's a good game, but don't overplay it as it could get repetitive.
rubny emile : one more song would be a nice addition, other than that great game, and the days and nights could be longer or shorter either way would be nice little touch...
amanda goddard : i have been waiting almost a year for it to come out on android. i have to steal my daughter's ipad to play!

pushpak dhawan : love the soundtrack
tom cheal : absolutely love this game, been waiting for it to hit the play store since i saw someone playing the ios version. the graphics and art style are incredible and i love it, reminds me of journey or monument valley slightly (which is a good thing!). the soundtrack and sound effects are great, really relaxing and immerses you in the world, the art style and graphics add to this as well. the game runs nice and smooth, and the controls feel satisfying. good job guys
a google user : didn't hear about this game until 10 mins ago. but now i'm loving it! brilliant piece of mobile game design! great visual style, the animations, time of day cycle and frontend ui are top notch. great soundtrack, very soothing and relaxing. extremely simple yet intuitive controls. it's free and i haven't encountered any paywall yet!
sahadat khandakar : its too difficult to jump the long distance, plz fix this. and ads ruins the experience -_-
a google user : i only have a single challenge left on my iphone so i'm glad they brought it to android so that i can play it again on a larger tablet screen. when i heard it's gonna be free i was afraid that i'll be stuck with a huge banner on the bottom of my screen every time i wanted to play the game but i must say that i love how they implemented the add system. my only issue is that every time upon loading, after the title disappears the screen goes black and stays like that for 20 to 30 seconds before the game starts. great game otherwise.
shamik kundu : have been waiting for it ever since it was released on ios back in early 2015. by far the best endless runner in recent times.
wisik pramono : the design is awesome, the score is great, and the story is simple yet appealing. i am having a good time.

jamie stewart : found it thanks to @cliffwade

vivek parmar : thnks for android...
tmx : alto's adventure is not just a skiing game but it focusses more on adventure and skills. you explore different places at different day cycles ( day and night), you perform skills such as grinding, grabbing and flipping. you can merge combos together with rock taps, and back flips. this game can be played on the go anywhere, anyplace and anytime offline. you must accomplish certain tasks to acquire a level to unlock different characters.
slowdown sloth : this is a wonderful game. loved it. but there is an issue. there is a glitch with respect to ads. if you momentarily keep the app playing in the background after clicking on watch ad and then open it from active apps the ads usually vanish but the reward for the ad is still given. like i could get unlimited coins by doing this. developers please note.
lorna lowder : fun game. love it on my phone. now want to try it out on the tablet. normally my type of games are based on knowledge, this is the first of this genre that i have really enjoyed. everytime it would list a more difficult trick i would think i could never learn how to do one and with practice, i can grind, flip and hover with the best of them. thanks for proving old ladies can learn new tricks too ;-)
mathew simko : fun, casual game. i love the art style. the music and the sounds are very
calming. the simple but, fun gameplay makes for a great game you can play
between breaks or if you need to pass time. i enjoyed unlocking all the
different characters (my favorite is the llama) and using their different
abilities. this is one of my favorite games and i highly recommend it
tim steinbach : you are just going down a hill doing flips and stuff. avoid the angry town guard and you will be fine. super entertaining. so entertaining i would play it while on the phone with my fiance, so if it can hold my attention while talk to the love of my life, it deserves at least 10 minutes of your time.
bossanater your boss : i am bread and butter. i will not be able to make it. i have to pay you back. i am a very good, and i will be a little bit close to the bone. she has to do you want me. the other side of things that you can also be used in 50th birthday party for my own personal injury law enforcement. i am going through the process of getting a new one. i will have to be a good day. i have a good idea to have to do with my. if you are looking for a few years ago and have to go back in time. i am going to the speech, and a.
erin nicole fernandez : i don't really post reviews, but this game really deserves it. you really get immersed in the setting. it's nice seeing the transitions in the enviroment, riding freely and back flipping, running away from elders. the visuals along with the music are breathtaking, and i especially like the fact that they added the zen mode, it's really calming and relaxing and i love it. would definitely recommend this game.
ameenath vifadha : ok i'm gonna say it...this is the most frustrating game i have ever played.
but i don't blame the game. i am not a very good gamer at all. it really
relaxing until the rocks start coming. i hate the rocks. but i have to
say...the graphics of this game is great the gameplay is really good. the
background is beautiful. i totally think you should download it (unless you
are impatient like me lol)
truth_is_the _new_hate : this game is amazing. the art style, the music, and the game play have an enchanting feel to them. very relaxing yet exciting to play. by far this is the best snowboard game on google play. and one of my top 3 favorite mobile games. it's not very often that a game gets this much praise from me as i am hard to please when it comes to gaming but the developers did an amazing job with this one. i'd love to see a number 2
naveen sharma : i've finished this game a long ago but i always come back to this because i never liked any android game as much as this one except "leo's fortune"... this game has that kind of vibes which will not only keep you busy but also entertained. i think ya'll should give this game a try.
a a : i don't normally review games but this is really beautiful. the gameplay is fun but the art style is absolutely gorgeous and even the interface ties in perfectly too. very charming game. one thing i don't like is when the guy on llamaback starts chasing you, it goes against the tranquile feel of the game i think. also would like if i could spend coins to customize the character (clothing, etc.)
ngc 12 : loveliest game i've ever played. it's so relaxing and really suitable to
play after a tiring day. all the graphics are just so great, beautiful and
soft i would say. the music is so comfortable. i can't wait to try alto
odyssey but before that, this is the best game and my favourite.
a google user : alto is a great game. very beautiful, fluent and bug free, and most important entertaining, even for game veterans loving challenges. it's easy to play but hard to master. even the ads which appear in the free version of the game are done well - they appear rarely and you don't even need to watch if you don't want to. well done developers!
annisa sabrina : this game is amazing in so many ways! beautiful art style, nice atmosphere, relaxing soundtrack outstanding sound effects, simple controls, intuitive game mechanics also addictive and entertaining gameplay. it is so well made and near the perfection. alto's adventure is almost everything that i've ever wanted in a game. despite of all its flaws, i really recommend it to everyone and you wont regret it once you've installed it
a google user : very interesting i was thinking to download a game under 70 mb because my
phone's storage was less but now i got this i am downloading the game and
will feed back you after 3 days guys . thank u. if agree with me then plz
hit like
shari s. : i was attracted to this because it reminds me of this game i played as a kid in prep school. there was this one mac pc in the computer lab that had this skiing game on it where you had to avoid obstacles like stones, trees and this yeti that looked like a kids scribble would eat your character xd. the background music is relaxing, in love with the graphics/how the sky changes from day to late afternoon. it's not too easy or too difficult. controls are easy to use. sometimes i just play to relax and ignore the goals even.
prakhar : this game is also available on xbox app in windows 10. graphics in 10 is same as in android version. the game has a bit positive impact on my mind. as compared to other games (with negative content) it is a good one. achievements make it special. the game features a mountain terrain with changing theme, for 15 minutes you have day then evening sunset then night. sometimes rain might start falling. overall this is my favorite game on mobile device as well as pc. that's why it is game of the year.
kaustav saha : alto's adventure lived beyond the expectations of it's user's.....it's soothing music, beautiful graphics and gorgeous scenarios with time variations is marvellous. it is fun as well as a relaxing treat to the eyes and the ears.i would like to request the noodlecake studios to upgrade this unique game further by adding more randomly appearing obstacles and forest animals....especially the characters should have more details and their uniqueness should be more stark during gameplay.
trevor sean olsen : this is one of the best games i have ever played. it lagged a few times on my galaxy s5 when i had other apps running. other than that it ran great, it is challenging, simple, and fun. i spend way more time playing it than i should. and the graphics are beautiful.
suvendu sarkar : it's very lovely game. background music is wonderful. which makes me remember something. but one thing is that some times it's not opening n lagging n crashing bit a lot..otherwise it nice..plss fix these issues..
fred ford : i love this game because it is buitiful and ralaxing. i don't like how the added adds and you have to pay for no adds! but i can cope with it. another good thing about alto's adventures is that you can do whatever you want on it because on other games you get set loads of targets and goals to complete. were as on this game, all you have to do is collect the lamma animal thingymabobs. you don't need wifi eather! i've got a good trick if you dont want adds but you don't want to pay for 'no adds'. all you have to do is go onto the game then switch the wifi off. vwala!
ethan erwin : really great has a good concept all though it is very hard to do some of the missions i feel it adds a challenging aspect most games don't have and coins aren't very hard to get if you upgrade your coin magnet but i think the cost for the wing suit is a bit ridiculous lower the cost it will make the game more fun. the last thing i won't to say its a bit lagy but other why's it has no adds and its very good thumbs up :)
kian howe : i've been playing this game for two years now and it's still a blast to try
to beat my old scores. even after completing everything from challenges to
achievements you can still enjoy alto's simple yet stunning graphics and
fun, easy controls.
christian bottorff : the game is fun as hell to play. i would love more than anything to see something just like this, but with skateboarding instead of snowboarding. it may seem out of place to put deep chasms like that in what i'd imagine would be a city setting, but i personally see that as an opportunity to make it fun, epic, and bizarre. exactly like what i feel a skateboarding game should be like.
mamta sharma : ------ join alto and his friends as they embark on an endless snowboarding odyssey. journey across the beautiful alpine hills of their native wilderness, through neighbouring villages, ancient woodlands, and long-abandoned ruins. along the way you'll rescue runaway llamas, grind rooftops, leap over terrifying chasms and outwit the mountain elders all while braving the ever changing elements and passage of time upon the mountain. features:
jack white : this is an overall beautiful game! the music and sound effects surround you, whilst the gameplay is smooth and relaxing. whilst there are unique characters and stunning graphics, my only improvements would be to carry on making more unique aspects so i can carry on playing for longer! excellent game, definitely a hidden gem!
aidan francis : very rarely do i rate a game and never have i wanted to do it without being asked. this game is a gem, it's controls are simplistic and easy to learn. it's art and day and night cycle are unique and absolutely stunning and it's soundtrack is something entirely different, it's something i'd listen to outside of the game and opening the app and hearing the music has got to be the most relaxing thing i've ever done on my phone! would recommend to anybody looking for something to spend countless hours playing!
daniel grooms : very fun game, much love for the indie devs. i did just have a problem where the app caused my phone to become unresponsive forcing me to remove the battery to restart. not sure if this was caused by the phone or the app. i'm using a galaxy s5.
jonel alexis caroc : the game mechanic was great, the fact that you'll have to catch those coins, llamas, and other stuffs are quite hard already, but the most hardest part was the background view, god its so beautiful! i can't focus on the course because its so tempting to look and stare at that view. i mean, look at that sunrise! you cannot just ignore it or not appreciate it, its just so damned gorgeous!
tia pagett : it calms me down and puts a smile on my face no matter what i always have a goal if its to get heaps of money to skip a task or to complete a task to unlock a new character i love it so darn much
sokol avdyli : this game has great graphics. i used to play it for a long time in ios and now im very satisfied its available and works like a charm in android. dont listen to noob people that say this doesnt work. they all know is how to use facebook.
sage serendipity : such a beautiful game! i wish i could walk right into it. it reminds me of monument valley with its gorgeous graphics! usually i'm not too fond of non-puzzle games, but this is one my exceptions! i love it! i don't even care about the ads in this game- and i hate ads! if you thinking about it, go ahead and try it out! you might just enjoy it.

a google user : graphics have defined this game. background music is so nice that it won't let the player get out easily. day and night sequence is one of the best parts of this game. thanks for making it and keep making such games.
rory carroll : i love it but a glitch has happened where i lose the money i collect and i am now on -30,000 coins so i can't get the purchase the wingsuit which is very annoying. please see if you can help just a update i am now on -40,000 but the money glitch has stopped and i am collecting coins,is there some way to reset my coins to 0
andy bennett : i love this game. it's the perfect thing for a phone or tablet. a simple idea for a little physics platformer pulled off flawlessly and with more care than similar games other developers crank out in swarms. with that said, i'll play the hell out of any sequel that this developer cranks out.
caitlyn burgin : this game is beautiful and peaceful and i love it but i'm not very good at time based machanics haha if this were turned into a pc game with adventure like the two brothers game i would be all up for it. even though i can't play it i still enjoyed it so 5 stars!
a google user : this game deserves 5 stars on every single aspect. it is too good to be a
free game but thank god it is. the graphics are pure breathtaking beauty
and controls are simple, the soundtrack is extremely peaceful and
mesmerizing, there are not too many ads. any person that does not have this
on their phone is missing out on the greatest experience that a phone could
give and anyone who rates it badly must have done it by accident. and i
just cannot wait for alto's oddessy!
