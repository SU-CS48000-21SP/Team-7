Neelanjana K : The game has a zen mode to it which really helps with stress and the graphics are really good . The game is an offline runniy game and is the best running game I've played . Visit me on Google play Games to be kept updated about my current games . I am HeraldWitch
Harsh Somaiya : I loved this game but in a past few days on my S20 5g in running game the touch stops responding and character stops jumping. Only way to solve is restart the game. The phones touch is still responding on all other apps.
Krishna M. : The graphics and the gameplay is nice..but it would be better if the character and obstacles looks little bit larger..
Luka Mukoski : As a great fan of side-scrolling arcades, this game really shows the great effort that the developers have put into the gameplay. Maybe it's not the best game ever made, but it certainly is the best of its kind.
A Google user : I adore this game...from music to characters, atmosphere, very very clean interface...and Zen mode is my favourite where there is no problem of falling and end-game...
Brennan Manning : This game is absolutely fantastic. This is one of those games where you can escape to a world that's peaceful and quit. The graphics music and the no ads are brilliant. This game is amazing.
Taylor Trimarco : It's good for the first couple minutes but then shoves ads down your throat the zen version though means no ads but if you are doing the regular version with score it starts to really push them down your throat
UCHIHA : I love this game , I don't usually give review to games but this game is beautiful animated, music ,sound ,concept and little details like switching on light as soon it is night , characters .I loved it
CHIGBO UGWUOKE : Extremely relaxing and kind of fun. And the Zen mode was just what I was looking for! Would recommend as a great offline time killer and relaxer.
Stephanie Kagle : This game- & its sequel- are true Zen. Gameplay is honed to perfection with clear love & care put into every aspect. There are ads & microtransactions like any free game, but it's very clear that this is a game first & the devs are not trying to milk every penny out of players as possible. Amazing all around.
Eudora J. E. : A bit hard to see obstacles, and if I say I'd rather end my run than watch an ad, it still plays an ad. Frustrating.
Philip Daniels : Everything about this game is amazing!! The controls, the music, the graphics, everything is so relaxing and I love it.
Gabi Eksteen : This game brings me immense joy. The music is as enchanting as the scenery. Easy game mechanics. Would be nice if you added an info section/storyline intro explaining the situation, game machanics and the elders.
Austin DiConti : Been looking for a chill game like this. Love the simple, but beautiful art style. Tired of mobile games that try to be too much, so this game is a refreshing change of pace
Terre Cabigas : This game is very relaxing as you said. Graphics are good, the sound effects, and the music too. It would even be better if there's a wide range of music to listen to!
Sam Wiens : The game works really well as something to pick and play once and awhile. With a simple concept it manages to stay entertaining.
Prateek Hegde : Hey guys great work.. I usually don't write reviews but thought this game deserves one... I just wanted to give a suggestion. Or maybe it's already there but I dunno... Can u add a feature of showing personal best scores... Maybe 5 or 10...that would be great
Strategic Master : Good graphics and stuff and very realistic. Recommended for people who are always on the go. Only problem for me is it can get a bit boring after a while. Good game
Wayne Loubser : Awesome game! If you don't download it then I'm sorry for you! But..... after the last update, the wingsuite doesn't feature as many times as usual, still not going to stop me from playing.
Carmen Berrios : Earn max points, make all your wingsuit and llama horn purchases etc., and be rewarded with twice the unsolicited popup commercials! Fun, excitement and thrills as you wait and wonder about what kind of garbage they'll interrupt your game play with! Enjoy!
Daggs234 : Beautiful game. Fantastic game to play on the go. I don't regret my purchase one bit. If you have extra money you want to blow, I cannot recommend this game enough. Fun, calming, breathtaking, and so much more.
Sarah H : OMG!!!!!!!! Best game in the WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??!??? I definitely would recommend this to a friend you should too it's got easy controls and it's easy to play and you should get the chance to get this awesome game
Who Cares : Practically no upgrading, they show you only money orders making it hard to find upgrades. All you do is try to backflip, catch Lala's and jump rocks. There's no objective and it's not relaxing, it's annoying by the tenth run.
Fabricated Krueger : Has good graphics, runs smooth. But can you make altos weight carry in the air and when he jumps, you lose so much speed. Thx
Jake Thamann : When I wrote a review on the sequel I decided to download this and its awesome!!! The soundtrack is even more relaxing then the sequel and the scenery is amazing really really good game!
Umakant Sahoo : It is also one of the best product of alto .it helps me in many way.its background music its control its scenery is the best. Its music also help me for many other way
Stylus Sticc : This game looks beautiful. I feel like it could be such a good game, but it's practically impossible to see the obstacles behind the foreground objects flying by.
Sakib Khan : As told before. Definitely a game to play. The scenario and music really are soul moving. This game really has gotten me through some rough patches of my life. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that provides a sense of calmness
Ham Bone : It's a fun game. But it's better if you play it on airplane mode because of all the ads that play for about 1min before you can close them.
Lauren Wickert : I love this game! I beat it once and then reset progress and am in the process of beating it again. It's always my go to for killing time.
Kartik Sharma : Only problem with game is if you choose to watch ad to revive player and by mistake you hit ad and playstore open. Then your gane will start from begining and all progress will be lost.
Akshat Jain : I love the game but after level 10 the game keeps crashing, it doesn't even starts now. Please look into this issue.
Thuwonna Nguyen : This game is so beautiful and relaxing. Would 100% recommend to anyone dealing with anxiety or stress. ❤️ Ps. If ads keep coming up you can simply turn off your WiFi or data
valluri Sundarrao : Review:- Alto's Adventure - An Enjoyable Snowboarding Adventurer Game. Rating:- 3/5. Alto's Adventure Judgment Is An Good Enjoyable Snowboarding Game. But Because Of For Few Minus Points, This Game Will Get Boring After For Some Time. And That Minus Points are Repeating Same Gameplay, And Controls And Execution Is just Okay.
Dominick Barberena : Finally a great and simple game that doesn't have too many ads. Great design and animations.
Madhav murmu : Chasing Game Much more interesting than running game easy controls night modes which comes automatically and keep running doing stunts. All who loves snow ski and snowboard likes much and love this game.
Quindace Poricallan : Only downloaded the game 6 hours ago and I'm having a blast 😍! Totally would recommend this game to others! (Warning: You might fall a sleep with the music) 😅 *Just Kidding * I love it! Best game I've downloaded this year! 💯💯😍😍
João Marcos Santos Teixeira : Great and rilex game. I gotten four star because the managers (not the developers) can put less advertising. If you don't play yet, try it! :-)
Arlee Schreiner : Its a fun relaxing game with a beautiful design. However, I will get random adds, or if i click watch add to revive charecter it will say add not available .
A Google user : The game is awesome ,is fun to play and simple ,very relaxing. thumbs up👌👍and the graphics are simple and beautiful.
Saba Farzanyar : I loved it. Highly recommended. It was free on my android❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Amazingly creative, detailed, beautiful and cleverly designed ❤❤❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻Best🌟 My only problem was that I did not understand the philosophy of elders following you. (Also turn off your internet then open the game, and you won't have any ads bothering you)
Daksha Patel : This is a great example that games don't require "graphics" to be amazingly beautiful. If I was a rich person, I'd give the devs a million dollars just for the beauty of this game.
Silerthin Prath : Amazing game. I've been playing this for a long time and have loved every second of it. From the music to the smooth game plays and the calming Zen mode, this game is for everyone.
Seasonal Allergies. : This is a game that i will never delete. It is so beautiful. Everything about this game is beautiful except for when you dont catch the llama or alpaca thing it eventually jumps off of the cliff but this game deserves a freakin 10 star. Absolutley brilliant in every way.
Haemathermal : It's so good and relaxing to play. The music and the background pictures are so fit. I also like Zen mode.
Johnny Walker : It used to be fun. That was before the intrusive ads. What used to be a super relaxing experience has been completely ruined. I understand the need to make money with ads, but they shouldn't ruin the whole experience.
Bubbles : For what it is, I live it. Spent about an hour straight completely immersed in Zen mode. I would usually leave a longer review, but the game just speaks for itself. Try it out.
Tyrese Harris : I love this 😍♥️ game so much. It's very fun and engaging. Also, I love the music in the background while you play. It's very soothing and relaxing for the mind. I would recommend this game to anyone 😂😁. Thanks to the creators!!!!!!
Savita Yadav : The game is good with cute graphics, easy controls... we can also chose different characters.. it's a nice game
Dean Anderson : This is an amazing game, probably my favorite mobile game ever. I got this game years ago and forgot about it, recently rediscovered it and love it. I've maxed everything out, and so I'm moving on to alto's odyssey, see you there!
HAVOC Controller playa : Very fun and addictive game i would give 5 stars but 2things need to change 1 the speed of the elders because if your using the 2nd character is to slow. 2 the backlip speed of paz. But overall a good game
雀Yui : First of all, Love the music!!!!! And even the bgm is undeniably cool. The gameplay is simple and graphics are neat and cute ♪ ♬ ヾ(´︶`♡)ﾉ ♬ ♪ it's not my ideal game bt sort of stress reliever.
Tenille Gajadhar : Every 2 games is an ad that can't close. Fun game but that ruins it. Can't really play the game with constant ads that won't close.
Yan Hesyandi : I was unlocked almost all character in this game (2 characters left) in my previous game, maybe it's 1 or 2 years ago. But when I install and log in to my account nothing happend, the character still locked. What's going on dude?
Lucas Johnson : the visuals are beautiful and very relaxing. The game itself is also challenging, and creatively interactive.
Brian Sammons : This is not relaxing in the least bit, absolutely anxiety inducing! Too fast to process the obstacles and the timing has to be exact.
Enan Louise : Good entertainment for those players interested in skiing and chasing llamas? Game play has you doing stunts, somersaults and avoiding rocks and signs on the ski slopes! It is a simple platform game that you can play when bored with nothing much on TV. 😊
hopping eagle : This game is good has good songs and grafics but the problem with the game is that after 3 games played it wont let you jump and you have to restart the app to play again
Jayashree Rajamani : This game is the best way to kill time! Helps you to keep up your presence of mind...You are constantly trying to collect coins and llamas, while avoiding stones and the bastard who chases you with a stick.
GreenAlien 51 : Boring and the the controls never work. You can't even jump. Have to restart the game only to repeat the same issue again.
A Google user : this game, unlike odessy is simple and doesnt force impossible missions, play this instead when you are docked at a starport because you are taking a break from fed grind in your beluga or when sdc is taunting you in the text channel, at least this simple 2D game will allow you to blow off some steam a little bit and when the grind of this game starts to dig under your finger nails just go back to grinding you federal corvette!
Sam Allen : This game sets a mood for adventure, this game will and trust me it will make you want to go out and see the beautiful landscapes of this world that you see in this game. If your like me as a kid you loved to go on adventures you would get this game, the nostalgia I felt playing this game would always live deeply in my heart.
Naveen Chand : Not able to get the free life after watching the videos multiple times. Forcing me to use the coins to continue playing.
Tonya Penn : Really wanted to play this, esp. in Zen mode. However, the app crashed during the tutorial. Great graphics though.
Nicolas Flamel : Extremely calm and concise game. Perfect sharp minimalistic graphics. Soothing music and simple controls all adding upto a pleasent experience.
Frick frack The snick snack is back : I like odyssey better for the inclusion of the balloons, but darn this one is beautiful!! A note to the developers, could you fix when llamas leap over chasms they don't hit the rocks or fall? Its sad to watch them die :(
Isabella Stratton : Possibly the most beautifully designed game with an easy game play. Lovely soundtrack. Moving and inspiring. Truly a masterpiece.
M M : The nostalgia from the music and this game i get when i play it is crazy. I played it back in 2015 and is still love it. Simple fun and nostalgic. No skill required just chill
Sagar Sonawane : Best game to pass the time. I play this gane for awesome graphics and soothing music. its really amazing to listen to the game music.
Ellie Anstis : Beautiful graphics and simple controls. Progression feels fluid and regular, strongly recommended.
Feldwebel Vertrauen : 10/10 game, beautiful graphics and amazing characters to unlock. Its certainly something I play when I'm feeling down or bored.
Solo Marco : This game is truly so amazing and especially the music is very clever relaxation. Even the quality graphic is so rare soothing and phenomenon too! I love it 🤩🤩🤩
Hari Rajeev : One of the most beautiful and relaxing,soothing game i've ever played...The music weather change,Tge Llama and the hill region...Feels like a heaven....Simple Graphics...etc....Stress relieving game for me....Thank you guys for making this game...❤
Ridley Soares : It is so fun, the engine is very simple, the sounds and effects, the interface are great, it is really nice to play.
Brian576nnm : This game is good the only reason why I don't like it that much is before it was free people had it for $4 and I was like why because you could get this on an iPad computer for free but you couldn't get it on phone for free so I found it bad because I'm thinking somebody reported that because it was free on all other devices but phone but it's still a really good game I would recommend that you should get it
Emma P : I used to play this game about a year ago, great game, so thought i would install it again. What have you done.....the adverts are constant whereas before there were none....big mistake
Joe Shmo : It's an ok game. Not sure why it's called Alto's Adventure. Should be called Alto's Snowboarding. It's basically a snowboarding game. Cool if you like snowboarding, but really kinda boring.
RoaringLionidas : so if your looking for a game with a deep story about lamas then you ain't getting day. if you want a simulator about raming into lamas then this game is perfect. although I wanted a story game😐 kinda annoying.
pk vines : It is very awesome app. It fells like real adventure . Whenever i play this game it likes i am there in the game. In the night the game look so awesome. It graphics also awesome . Best offline game ever i played . If there were 100 stars i will give it 100 stars.
Tulika Sarma : I've been trying to download it from half an hour now. Its says 100% download and then again starts downloading from 0%. I don't know what is going wrong. Edit: Somehow I was able to download the game and it is just OSM..... Just play this game u will never get bored of this game, and the music & sound of this game is so soothing. Jst LOVED IT ❤️
Coal : Its just as good as the sequel if not better. The massive looming mountains, the endless hills, i just love everything about this game! It is so much fun and its hard to put down.
Silmi Asy : Actually this is a very good game. The graphic is sooooo good. But the thing i hate is the rock or something size is too small. I can't see that and then i died adn i hate it so much.
Myk Dowling : Charming game with a great soundtrack. Not hugely challenging, so a low frustration level.
Cassandra B. : Beautiful game! I found this game on my RAs... This is a gorgeous game with little ads and smooth gameplay. I look forward to seeing more of your games, guys! Keep it up!
Eli Heinrichs : Honestly this is the best mobile game I have ever played. Relaxing yet challenging, failing is rarely ever frustrating. The wingsuit is a must have
EZRA KOECH : Beautiful game. If you read previous reviews then you probably know by now it's graphics are great and it's very relaxing in its game play. You also probably know it's best played offline lest you love ads. All the same, great job devs.
Hanasanxii : it's one of the best casual mobile games i've ever gotten. the objectives system keeps you from being bored, and the characters are really fun. 5/5, keeping this game forever
Cameron M : The only reason why i gave this 4 stars is because it feels and looks like some sections were created with little thought to the section before or after it. Other then that it's perfect.
Twin games : The game is very calm and slow,letting you injoy the music(Recommend using headphones). If you like fun adventure games,you'll find this game fun.
Robin W : This was my most favorite game. I still used to play for relaxation. I just turn on some melody songs and paly this games. The graphics in this game is very Great. Mainly the Sunset & Sunrise.
Weebs Kingdom : Nice game generally.. stunning graphics and mostly i love that it had zen mode..and the music is very very soothing and relaxing.. highly recommended if you wanna pass tine in a relaxed yet enjoyable manner
Nerd Nerd : IT SO GOOD,relaxing challenging,how else can i describe it,but... somethimes it freezes and I have to leave the game then come back.
A Google user : Really an amazing game. I love it's mind relaxing soundtracks. Background, graphics (beautiful sceneries)and everything are sooo good. I play this game when i need a relax on my mind. love it soo much. Not enough 5 stars. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Gaurav Dabhole : Very nice game. But on high speed there is a glitch due to which it doesn't collect the coin. If anyone from the designers reading this comment repair it.
Whistling Whiskers : Damn rocks! Good game. Not sure I'm able to heighten my ability to maintain a hasty type of focus. Challenging. I need to stay on edge, that's the ticket!
Christina Jonas : Amazing art, fun but challenging game, and relaxing feel overall. Worth the little bit of real-world money.
Cr Be : Boring. Too much of the same thing over and over. Played for 10 minutes and I'm over it. Visuals and audio are stellar!!Just too repetitive for me.
Mina Magdy : It's cool game but it becomes boring to repeat all the same stuff all over again whenever you loose, and the tasks getting impossible the be done without watching the ads
Arokia Nathan : This is one of the most decent games I've ever played, there are so many things to it, the theme itself is simply magical and I love love love the zen mode. Totally recommend it :)
cakey14 : I adore this game! It is so beautiful. The sound design is amazing, I especially love the thunder storms. Zen mode is unbelievably calming. I love everything about the game!!
A Google user : Very fun time killer, no pressure to buy things to enjoy the game and advance thru first 30 levels, plus Zen mode is awesome relaxing.
M0nst3R : One of the best mobile apps I've ever had!! Has never lagged before and helped me relax sososo much!! I would 1000% recommend installing this if you're struggling with autism or adhd (like me) bc it helps me fidget sooo much!! Love it!!<33
Yova Vasquez : Beautiful game, love the experience and the soundtrack pfff just majestic! Keep the good work guys! Also, you can plan offline so that rocks!
Mar Pink : I used to play this game with my mom back in my freshman year of high school. I graduated two years ago, and just recently re-download it. Maybe it's the good memories, but I find this game to be extraordinary. It's got lovely music, a simple but fun premise, and beautiful scenery. It never fails to make me smile.
Louise Goethals : SO BEAUTIFUL. I could stare at the game for hours. Looove the day-night cycle and the weather. It's just such a relaxing, fun game that can also prove quite challenging!
Tariq Wiliams : graphics are beautiful but why are there so many distractions like showing best distance when a rock is approaching and you can barely flip.
michael aniekwu : Great to pass time, straight forward - I dig it. Rocks sometimes blend in with scenery so watch out! Lol | May show up differently on your device.
Mr. Kangaroo : Best game ever played in my life. I played many games like PUBG, Fortnite, Among Us, Hill Climb Racing 2 and many more in offline but never seen so much simplified and adventurous game like this. This game should deserve 4.5+ starts I don't know why people dislike even the most lavish games like this one.
Wolfna Fandom : I LOVE THIS GAME!!! my fav part bout it is that it has zen mode and i love listening to music while playing games but dont like ads cause it pauses the music but bc of zen mode u cant die and if perfect for me <3
Sri Anjan : The game graphics is absolutely awesome and the music is great it will give a great experience in short time 👍
Zombie SS : Never thought I'd be saying this for a game, but this a great stress buster. The best thing one can do before a good night's sleep is to play this game. Music is best I have ever seen in an android game. Lags a bit sometimes, but not regularly.
RobertShelly Bingham : Amazing!!!!!!!. I have PTSD from the war and this game is one of the most relaxing games ever. When I start to feel anxious or panicky....I can play this game and it soothes me. Great work. Hope to see more levels.
Jose Tom : This has to be the most beautiful game I have ever played. Why didn't I discover this earlier?? I'm such an idiot. Everything about this game is amazing.. I just love the music, the scenary.. Everything!! It's so beautiful!! 5 stars!!
roan roberto : Something I didn't know I needed. I find it very relaxing especially on the zen mode. I love the music and the graphics. Good job. 😊
A Google user : absolutely amazing game.... thr graphics are amazing thr scenery is gorgeous and the music is awesome ... mostly i loved the music and the Zen mode. The game is calming and awesome
Niranjan P M : The game takes us into the world of majic where we dream that if we were in that place such an amazing game more than playing experience it it will take us into some other place such an experience was mine and the graphic also the slow motion is all amazing🤩😍👍
Poorava Kumar Meena : Minimal graphics with beautiful background and background music. Great game for relaxing. It's fortunate that it is available free.
Nicole Satiembre : I hate that I always lose the game 😡 'cause the graphics's just too beautiful, I get distracted everytime XD. Love this game fr. Very relaxing. Would highly recommend 💯
Abrar Shafin : best game i ever had! music is awesome .those lightnings , the graphics is too much charming. controlls are great and the main part The story! just woow🔥
tiggerforhim : I never review. This is so good. So easy to pick back up after being away. A pleasure. One of only 3 mobile games l have kept and keep returning to, at the end of the day.
Christian Batchelor : Pretty relaxing, but the magnet causes a 1 second freeze that can get you killed and the feather doesn't work until you jump. Pixel 3XL
Betsy Downes : Such a cute little game on the go, no need for internet, and such fun levels and loads of character's in the game! I loved playing it everywhere!😁
Mr. Man-Man : Best mobile game I've played in a while. It plays well, has a reasonable amount of ads, and looks nice. Would reccomend.
Алехсандър Василев : The game is good everything is good. but the ads.. i finished my goal in a game and escaped that police guy but after that i died. THEN i was thinking i finished it untill a ad poped out and it got me out of the game i went back and EVERYTHING WAS LOST.
Dave Eccleston : Do you love ads? Then you'll love this game. Couldn't even play it sometimes because the ads took over the screen. Uninstalling.
A Google user : All I want in a game. Especially the revenue model: Not too many ads and a smart way to pay for additional content. Probs!
Mark Rodenhauser : Don't understand the hype, it's a pretty random ski slope generator with nice relaxing music and sound effects. Woohoo. Should be free with minimal ads. I think the reviews are shills - all 5 star say same things "relaxing". The actual gameplay is not well thought out, and hardly any real content... Nothing ever PROGRESSES in this game and the primary skill you hone is distinguishing llamas from rocks in the dark and foreseeing the future to avoid random rocks that are unavoidable if you jumped
Cute Cell : The only thing is all traps are not shown put a signal for rocks or traps, and the controls are terrible! This review is for alto's odyssey too.
Arlon Wiba : Smooth clean graphics. Easy to pick up and play. A perfect game to play in the train on your commute.
BEAGLEDORE : This game is beautiful the graphics are awsome. The gameplays not perfect but I mostly like the graphics and sunsets in the game.
Justin James : Amazing game! Loved the soundtrack and it blends so well with the gameplay. Helps me relax a lot. Kudos to the developer.
golden cut : Visually appealing but that's about it. Minimal gameplay. Maybe coffee wasn't the right substance to use while playing the game tho...
il était une fois : This game has stolen my heart the scenario gameplay song n everything in it is of the charts n this makes me feel comfortable especially the Zen Mode. It worth ,keep it up
Ahmed Raza Shibli : the game is fantastic and the music im zen mode. damn it's so perfect and peaceful i really loved it and it helps me relax a lot. thanks a lot to the devlopers of this game. loved it so much
Zubaida Abdulkader : This was a gud game once but now lot of bug and lags and also can u add something like online multiplayer or new maps or final option a new game just like this with better graphocs and other stuff and different mode like hard mode or easy mode or normal mode
Dany Abboud : Best game even .Peaceful silent music and very good graphics easy controls .it is a world of adventures anf peace. Keep the good work .
Public puffin : Amazing graphics and gameplay. Love it One improvement is to extend the day time and add a ,just night or just day button for zen mode🐙😃 Well done developers good job ! 😆
Creative Chris 2 : I didnt play this game much so idk much about it but I think that the character is small and that he could be bigger because some people can't see well with how tiny he is. My cousin says it's a good mobile game.
Josh Gordon : Alto's adventure is a pretty game with simple and intuitive controls that anyone can understand.
Dovah Kiin : I've played this game before... As I keep switching fones I keep downloading it again. This is by far the best game on the play store. It is indeed a solid 10/10...if you do not believe me, play zen mode
mohammad zahdeh : Thank you so much for this app! I know this is gonna sound stupid but I've been going through some rough times and alto really helped me through it, the zen mode is just too calming and amazing! Thank you again for such a wonderful app
Rajesh T : Both games are good,calm and meditative. Can you add some additional features please.
weirdo person : This game is the best! I play it from my android and nothing is wrong. The gameplay is addicting and so fun! And the music is beautiful! 11 out of 10 would recommend
Benjamin Spitz : The game crashes every time I activate the wingsuit. The in-game ads are repetitive and obnoxious. Fix the wingsuit and I'll consider contributing to the devs.
• Delirium • : This game is fun and challenging. It is great to play when you're bored cause it keeps you on focus and entertained. And the graphics are absolutely gorgeous.
MLG LukyKing : Amazong Game just amazing. its music is well made and played its envirnments are well designed while also being very simplistice with its shape. Overall a great game in this over saturated gaming market. but heyy thats just my opionin so try it out
ara gureghian : I like both games but as another review wrote PLEASE fix the fact that chasms even with speed cannot be jumped! Most. That is ridiculous as it should be a simple fix... Please get to it or I just have to uninstall. No sense playing this game at all...
Matthew Burdick : Absolutely fantastic game! The graphics and music are great. a very calming and relaxing game.
A Google user : The in-game ads make this game unplayable. I don't see a way to pay to remove the ads; maybe I already paid and I don't remember. Whatever. Uninstalling this and Odyssey. Too bad, it looks like a fun game.
Xassassin play's : It is not bad because the game is what it says it looks like but there are tons for glitches and I got my phone 6 months ago and this runs fnaf ar but yet this game sometimes don't jump when you gain speed and it is a slow restart also my game lags at random but somehow this phone can play fnfa ar perfectly and this game glitches meaning this game is laggy and fnaf ar has more lag but it moves smoothly on to his phone but not my other meaning this game is laggy like hell and sucks.
Steve Martin : The game is great, the adds are abusive. I understand showing me ads if i want to continue with a run but to force ads on me if i want to start over? To much.
THUNDER LIGHT : I love the game and it has everything the sun comes up and the sun goes down which i really like. What i love about the game is that its a amazing relaxing, steady, aesthetic game keep up the good work because its amazing
ANUP KUMAR : Simple but good graphics . But , the best thing you will like in this game is its sound effects . I love the sounds and feel relaxed
harsha vardhanreddy : It is one of the best offline games I've ever played.aIt has Excellent graphics, Nice gameplay and superb controls.
Divya Jyoti Sharma : this is by far the most relaxing game I have played. no stress. you can talk and play it. and also it can be played offline. I have played this game for 4 yrs now. hasn't disappointed me yet. if you are looking for a chill game with calming scenery this game is for you.
Tom Lynham : It's pretty but awfully boring. I appreciate other reviewers comments about the beauty of the design, fluidity, etc. but after about fifteen minutes and a few frustratingly invisible obstacle flops I wondered, "is this it?". I guess I'm just not Zen enough.
General Prodigy : An abdolute masterpeice. Its casual and simple yet difficult to master. Keeps one engaged for however much one wants. The scenery and the graphics actually make me feel like im back in Nepal
Swaroop Sahoo : Very cool graphics and good soundtrack to go with. Can add different modes though.
tabrej shaikh : It's much nice game it s quite simple and nice when I played the game I feel relaxed an my all stress is gone I feel very good to play these game an would really like to give thanks to the game company but I would like to tell that add some challenge and sceans etc
Yup lord : Well made and absolutely stunning visuals and it makes me gush at the soundtrack. Amazing game to unwind to offline.
Munachiso Enwere : If you are planning to download this game save your data am find something else, cause this is just a total waste of time....you would be doing the same thing over and over no new game environment....mtcheeew
rida : It's good game and I loved it but there a problem in it sometimes I can't jump and a have to reopen the game to fix this problem and sometimes it doesn't work so I have to do it again and again to fix it so please help me and fix it
Jameel Ali : Nice peaceful game with awesome graphics & weather effects. Simple & easy controls. Cool menu navigation.
Jafor Siddiqee : Theres a great influence of background music in this game,i dont know 'bout others but the bgm just makes me feel good in every mood,in this game. I dont know if my review could be seen by devoloper,still i wanna make a request to change the bgm after every match,,atleast 5/6 bgm will be enough,that can be played after every matches one by one,hope it will be devoloped in next update💓
Lucy 8 : I love the game it's so peaceful but you all need to fix the sensitivity when it comes to landing if the tip of the board is it should count like if you lean back just a little you'll crash Please consider my request thank you
Cleavon Olivera : This game is awesome. The animation style used is very nice. Overall game is smooth and peaceful. The game is simple but I think there is room for improvement in the game play.
Cheyenne Jordaan : Can someone please tell me how to fly proximity wingsuit. I like this game alot and I won't mind telling my friends about it..if someone could maybe do something about all the adds..i see every player complain about the adds
Jgouken : Very, very calming game. Can be played offline, amazing graphics, and an all-round calm experience.
Aaron Minsk : Great casual game. Sometimes gets really dark and I have to turn up the brightness, but otherwise it's a good looking game.
Scott Vander Meulen : Perfect. Beautiful artwork and sound design, happily paid a few bucks for the ad-free version.
Moonlight Gachav : This is an amazing game. The music is relaxing the graphics is amzing the setting.... everything! is just amazing
Johannah Dube - MU : This is by far one of the best game experience I've ever had. The graphics, the music, the vibes are just from a different dimension. Definitely a 5 star
Shafayat Jamil : The best way to timepass. It's not addictive like other games but fresh your mind. A journey towards beautiful scenery and with background music actually motivate you
Harry Morderer : Nice music graphics but sooo boring gameplay just jump and turn around is that all and its really really see those rocks in the dark. I may want to play on roar to school during day time and its immopaible to see rocks unless you want to make your beightness max and kill your batery
saideep samineni : yeah,its good to play for some days....but its sucks if you play all the time.bcoz we really have only one map and the same man goes and goes....i hope they include more maps and more challanges.i got bored quicikly,but i do have the app with i play when ever i get bored.
ParaShiftY : So far, its not addictive but its one of the best games you can ever play, its calm, stress relieving. Hoping for more updates.
Colleen Sequeira : It's a wonderful concept and a great vibe. But it's frustrating when it gets dark. I can't see the rocks! This game shouldn't have night time
dibrisco : visually stunning and fun. the quests are easy to achive but push you further each time. you dont need to pay or get good to enjoy it
My Tab : This is one of my favourite games, period. But the only annoying fact is the lack of an ONLY NIGHT mode, I request to yall pls pls pls enable for us loyal followers a night only mode, that would be way way way more soothing to play 🧡
Ethan Rice : Fun game, works pretty well free, spending money isn't a complete waste, beautiful graphics and game feel. It's a game app that is actually a good game.
Neo Dufour : Excellent! The only problem I'm facing is the incompatibility with the notch of the OnePlus 7. If this can be optimised it would be great!
Aswin P J : Can you please include an option to force night time in the game. I usually play the game in bed and the color changes are really irritating. Please include an option to force 'dark mode'
Leane Dias : its great.just need help transferring my level from another device because i don't want to start over. google play is signed in on both but for some reason on the new device it makes me start from scratch.
Caren Travaso : Love the game! But, for some reason on tapping Alto doesn't jump. So, it gets unplayable.
Kevin Hunter : I would love this game if it worked when I tap to jump. Why does it only work sometimes and very rarely? What's the point in playing this game if I can't jump and I just smash into rocks every time?
Ok Boomer : Its beautiful 😍 the levels are meticulously crafted and even thought its in 2D the controls are easy to understand 5/5 for me.
A crazy Coder : This is sutch a wonderfull game. Simple, smooth grafics, and a good consept. It was a full 5-star game, but then they added advertisements. Why? What happened?
Gulammustufa Naiyer : I'm very disappointed due to some add like colour bump 3D which don't have option to shut it down, and it keeps on playing on my screen. and due it I have to loose my scores achieved
Willy Illuminatoz : comparing with alto's odyssey, this one is not better. I really hate the elders, rocks, and sound of bunting rides which is hurt my ear.. the biomes are not attractive and less variative.. also i guess there is supposedly no rain in snowy area.. nothing's new..
Richard Coote : This game came highly recommended. It needs serious work, it is frustrating when it it takes you 3 days to do one flip. Very slow.
A Google user : my friend really loves this game, but it's been 2 hours and it still hasn't downloaded. I might change this once it installs, but until then, the clock is ticking
Phoenix ! : This is literally my favorite game ever. I would love to see a racing mode with friends (when you fall you wake 1 second before you get up)
Alex Michael : What a wonderful game this is. This is just a normal game tho but what makes it special is its design. It's music and it's look. It just uplifts the person. Overall the game is good.
MD. Mikata Khan : It is easy to learn but hard to mastar.it has a variety of gameplay.It has a very relaxing and calming music.
Vikas Saahil : The game is fantastic and makes u calm and more peaceful.The music so refreshing and calm that if u r angry or tierd of doing work ,u can play this game for 5 or 10 minutes only and u will be calm and happy at the end!!! Developers u have done a great work!!! I really appreciate this!!👌 Thank you😊😊
Soham Kumar Sahu : Beautiful and peaceful game. Soothing music along with simple graphics makes it a very interesting game to play.
Nalule Erine : This game is great. Equally challenging as it is relaxing.Not forgetting it's beautiful graphics and music.
Konrad Okoński : It's a poor man's version of Ski Safari 1. You'd be better off playing that one- better controls, far less "skip this" and "watch this video".
Tiberius Octavius : Alright the game has much less ads and you don't pay for a lot of things but there's just not a lot to do. I wish there were something like levels or campaign.
The Rogue Sammy : Simple but really enjoyable. It's got great music, an additcting adventure, and not too much bullsh*t pay to win stuff.
Markus : Amazing art and great soundtrack. I don't find the gameplay to be really engaging though.
Vishnu Vardhan : The game has a bug that if we fall into a chasm and revive, the character will be inside the chasm and will not run it'll stay there only and the distance is also showing 9000m, 9001m and again 9000m and repeats.
Darshik Purohit : Worth it! Although it's upto the game to make you reach to the next level.. but you will love it.. might also remind you of old paramount logo.. 😂
Meljo Piapot : I love this game! The music and the game itself is so relaxing, it's easy to play, and the graphics are AMAZING. Definitely worth 5 stars!
ravi varman : This game is good the animation is fantastic but they can do many improvments in the game like changing charecters and costume design and new skte board
Naomi Toju : Honestly, one of the best games I have played so far. Both the music and the art is beautiful and relaxing, especially on Zen-mode.
J T : Beautiful graphics, simple controls, fun challenges. Love this game.
Sivaram Achu : Wow, this game is really amazing and its healing mind .this game is i started i vanish and i came my imaginer world. iam so inspire,, that mountains, that beautiful sunshines and sunsets, spring and winter seasons changes. This is my imaginer world... Thank to the teamworkers of this game.
Nicholas Morgenstern : Redundant in minutes. Forces ads with jarring music/sounds you cannot close without being taken to the play store.
Warryck Wade : This is a PERFECT game. Visuals are amazing, it's Zen Mode is very calming, mechanics are perfect, and Fluid gameplay. If you don't know if yoy should get this game or not, GET IT
Bikoomixc : It is the Best Game on The App Store. Very fun and it does not make you spend lots of money. I would recommend the add free version but you can do without. 👍
Pawan Kumar : I die again n again. I an can't control me watching background and listing music. While playing this game i was lost in dreams like mountain and peace of mind. This game is best.
Kundan : Shittiest app. Ads completely destroy the experience. Ads never go away and keep repeating. There is no way to exit ads. There is no exit button. This app is a huge scam.

A Jibaly : Cannot synch gameplay. Seems excessive to be forced to purchase this game on every device you play it on and additionally have to start your progress all over.
Paul C : Good graphics, but the game is boring. You just tap the screen to jump or hold to backflip.
Avery : Very relaxing!! (Especially in zen mode) It could use more music choices though.
Kazi Abdullah Arman : This game is so nice!!! It's so relaxing and peaceful. I first played this game back in 2018 and playing it now reminds me of the fun I had playing this game before. Well, I actually loved it but Imma rate it 4 stars. Also, you can play this game on PC.
Matthew Nisbet-Forster : I remember when this game was introduced on sky news and I was so happy when it came out. It's such a cool and so relaxing and the music and graphics make want to play it for hours
AppleUser#00 : Very good experience All its need it different maps and jt will be a 5 star. It has not noticeable bugs or anything related to that. Very good game
Omar Fouda : Compared to Alto's Odyssey, this game has worse graphics, worse soundtrack, bugy gameplay, and worse missions.but still a nice game.
Evan Corley : This game is fun to play but the jumping sucks and the only way to make those big jump is with the speed boost that's also bad sicne you only get it when flipping over things, other than those things it's pretty fun to play

Utkarsh Pathak : Loved the game. Wonderful environment. Just can't believe how such a simple game can be so addicting. Everyone should try the zen mode.
Rohit Kumar : The best relaxing game I have ever seen❤ I feel sleepy after playing this game for 15mins Music is soooooo nyz.and sound of rain and fx like thunder and all are just nyzzzz. How can a simple game like this become sooo Addictive!!!!!! Good work 👌👍👍👍
Kartik Tambi : Incredible Game, exceptional Graphics and Sound. This game (and Alto's oddessy) helps me relieve myself, I love it. Sadly, Playstore has a limit of only 5 stars.

Althaf M.a : alto's adventure is a good game . The tasks were very interesting ,which is very anxious about the next tasks . It's an interesting game ..
imnotquitesure : This is honestly a great game, it's a great time killer and unlike most cheaply made mobile games on the app store, it has very few ads.
Anupama Bharadwaj : A visually beautiful game that has a special place in my heart. I am not the type who plays video games because they feel violent but not this game. This game is enjoyable and thrilling.
josephwheeler1 : You playing for like 20 or 30 seconds and then crash then you have to watch a video or pay to play again or exit out and restart it could be fun but it takes forever to start over again.
David Evans : Forcing me to watch an advert after every run now is really putting me off recommending it to anyone. Shame. It is such a good game.

Dana Cousins : If you're looking for a simple game with easy goals this is it. I can easily say this is my favorite game ever. I wish there were more games like this. Even the music is relaxing.

Tabantha : Love the graphics. The ads and the fact that it won't register my touchscreen consistently sucks.
Saberi Marais : Game is good however there was inappropriate advertising while my child was playing it, so I uninstalled it. Sorry but it's not worth having it installed if that filth (18+ content) is being advertised during the game.
Ayush Sarkar : Amazing adventure game with wonderful scenery and calming music.It creates a sense of introvert and creates a soothing atmosphere around me in a pleasant way.I usually play this game when I feel sad and it makes me feel cheerful.Deserves 5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟, nothing less than that.Excellent creation,love it💖💖.

Madhab Bhaskar7 : this is more than just a game.this game is best in its own way with full of adventures.the way the weathers transform and the lighteninng effect makes it most addictive.i hope this comment would inspire you to make more games like this.this game is awesome in headphones and high refreshed devices......

A Google user : I don't know what's wrong with this app, but every time I start playing this game my phone turn off the screen within seconds of play, otherwise game is very interested once you start playing
Marko Markovic : After tutorial you suddenly can't jump over chasms even after going downhill. That's because when you die you can watch an ad to get revived. Scummy practice

Barb Propst : I do like this! It's relaxing to play & the music is calming. I love trying to see how far can I go. The Zen mode is wonderful!!!
Arman syah : Ok this game is not bad but....its just boring....it lacks fun....take example temple run,subway surfers,jetpack joyride...all of tht is fun...items,powerups, skins AND limited events...this game...is basically a cash grab....skins cost money ALL OF THEM, not only tht it simplicity makes it boring....its like a game tht has been dead....the only thing its good is the graphics its amazing! But...overall....kinda dissapointing since this is AN EDITOR CHOICE....
SHAYLEE BESTER : Wow this is an amazing game with good graphics .The game has a normal mode which is very fun an a zen mode which is very calming. I love this game , would definitely recommend.
SNEAKY_SNIKER08 : If your looking for a relaxing game this is it, i love to just go on the free mode so when you crash then you could restart right there.
Eloy PM : Easy to learn and a fun way to kill time. Beautiful and yet simplistic graphics.
Start Now - Game End : Love it really good to relax and play a mobile game. Headphones are needed for a nice relaxing experience.
Bappan Mazumdar : I just feel a uniqueness whenever I play this game. Don't know why the overall game sequences touches my heart. The graphics , sound overall it's up to my emotions
Ben Humphrey : Significantly worse than Altos Odyssey, not because of the features, but because of the amount of ads.
RS N : There's a bug that prevents taking input if I crash while holding down the jump button. Please fix.
Carly Gallagher : The graphics are peaceful and game play is fun but when the time changes to night it's hard to see the rocks

Abraham Obaid : Sub par. Ad's on a game I paid for? Disgusted and let down. This game is not worth the 2 bucks and the ads will make u hate every single person who was involved in making this abomination.
Epic Emerald 2 : This game is fun for about a year. Then it gets really boring and the quests get super hard late game.
Elite Nuka : beutoful graphics but sometimes you cant jump even you restart the game again and again,if you cant jump you will die , so how can I play fix the bugs and I will give 5
Ganesh Karhale : This game is awesome. The visuals are stunning and graphics are beautiful. Opening this game takes some time but it is worth it.

Ben Jones : Minimal with a calming soundtrack. Perfect game to pass the time or to aid in relaxing!! Love it!!

Yos Doggo : Sound is relaxing, gameplay fun. Minimal ads, super fun, especially on long, tedious car rides.
Ed. Paul : I like the mechanics & animation of this game! You guys should make some other games with the same engine/developers. This game keeps me sane.

Naresh Kumar : The gameplay, soundtrack, graphics are all wonderful, it brings a calm, relax kind of feeling. Love it.
Sara M.S : This game is so great, it has a great theme music, great environment and calming. If your willing to download a relaxing nice game, then download Alto's adventures. 👍☺️🌼
Bhavya Bhardwaj : Casual games always make me wonder, how some things can be best even whey do not offer so many options. Simplicity at it's best.
A Google user : The game looks really beautiful, + the music, but I didn't like that you have to restart again when you fail.
Michael H. Pedersen : Nice graphics and all. But in the end it's the same as most other mobile games....single finger tap action...which grows boring quickly.
Opal Littman : This app is so fun, I am surprised it is free. It is calming and relaxing, the adds are a bit much but if they were to lower the amount of adds they would have a 5 star rating from me.
Justin Carico : I think this game is truly extraordinary because the game is about alto going down a mountain that never ends and it makes me wonder what is at the end and it also makes me wonder what makes alto want to go to the end. And other than that a good game and I wonder what is altos story.
Rakhi Saha : I just love this game after 2 years later i have played a enjoying game. Whoever has made this can you make an updated version which can we race with other people online.
alyssa w : Really fun and relaxing! Highly recommend if you want a game that you can just sit and play between classes or work!
Faridah Haliru : I can't seem to load the progress on my old device onto my current one. I can sign into my Games account, but I for some reason I have to start from scratch. I want to be able to continue from where I left off on my previous device. Alto's Odyssey doesn't seem to have this problem, so why does this game?
Yung SHIM : It's a great game timing is key just flow all the way down with aldo and various characters which perform differently based on how you like powering down the hill it's siick💯
Clark Collins : It's already frustrating enough that you can't see rocks well in night time but a NPC chasing me who is automatically faster than me is complete BS. Uninstalled!
Sen Somdev : This is not good game, it is the great game. I am a filmmaker very selective about my time spending and it worth my time I play both adventure n odyss!
Yael : AMAZING GRAPHICS! If youre looking for a challenging and fun game, then this is the game for you. Im only so far into the game and already know i love it. I do recommend it. I love this game and you are going to, too!
Delaney R : very relaxing! only thing is when the llamas are running down hill they glitch and shake really bad. other than that though the game is amazing!

Arun : I love the game so much. It makes me relaxed. The beautiful scenary along with the peaceful music makes the game more intresting. Good game keep it up
luc michaud : I use to play this game all the time. It has some fun progression and is hard sometimes. It is what I would want every mobile game to be like.
Jegathesh kumar : This game has everything it needs to pull me in. Not a word more or less would be unjustifiable for the game's serenity and visuals it's about to show.
Rajesh Ketala : One the best game I have ever play , especially the music. sounds of thunder and rain are best . Use headphones to feel the game .
Kevin Hsu : Used to love this game but it won't open at all and hasn't in months. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times but it hasn't worked at all.
FoxDuty XD : There is no reason would make me rate this game less than 5stars but it needs more songs in it. And if u made one more game with some planets views would be very nice.
Blesson Thomas : Amazing satisfying game...better than odyssey...its more dynamic and exciting. The graphics and music is amazing.
A Google user : Fun and addictive simple runner game. The visuals and music are what makes this game more appealing.
Satyam Deb : Game is very nice it would be 5 star if you glow the blocking obstacles in the way because its harder to identify them and its more harder to see them on night this is only the problem you should solve.
Achilis Dragoon : Simple and beautiful. I love this game. Almost have this for a year I think. Honestly, haven't played a game as beautiful and relaxing as this before. Thanks guys ❤️
Noel Lelçaj : Great game but Altos odyssey is better because it has more fluent animations but this game has dynamic weather. It depends in your personal "taste"
Nila Wilson : I is amazing, it's very calming and fun and too excited, it's just simple and fun, and if your looking for a relaxing game I would recomend this game.
mukesh naidu : It is the best game for time pass and to play in lockdown best but . There are problem such as the rocks can't be seen in the daytime And we should buy coins in the store
Kaidyn Green : I rate this app at a 4 because I'm not sure if I can get the other people and I really hope other people have a nice day for a year and a year and you can do it for a year and a month or two days and then I love the game because I'm so addictive to the game that I forgot it was Monday today oh shoot I have school today but anyways I love the game because of the gratifications of the game it's so awsome and it I hope you guys impressionistic people like this game see you all later and it is 1:59
Saaniat 1309 : love this game... it's cool & fresh music help you to get out from all kinds of mental problems that's why i love it more than others game... & it is not so much hard games like others
Marius Claassen : Player on screen way too small. Unnecessarily difficult to see the rotation angle of the character when doing tricks. This is especially true when tge backround is at night
Saket Kumar : Gorgeous looking backdrops and smooth gameplay. But I got burned really quickly , it's repetitive and not so fun after a while
ylan : was happy with this game but nowadays I keep doing the tasks 3 or 4 times without it being counted as a victory. I'm afraid i can't play it anymore.
Kirsten Sweeney : I absolutely love this game. The zen mode is really nice to play if youre relaxing or listening to an Audiobook. Would highly recommend!
Ian Michael : The game is pretty fun but the fact that you just have to run, make some stunts is just boring. It is just for relaxation purposes. It's fun and I love it❤️
Brandon Edblom : This game is fine. It has a few bugs, like sometimes, you can't jump at the start of the game even though you can. Aside from that, it can be fun from time to time. Maya is OP and I don't mind.
Meghna Jayan : This game delivered a very different experience. It's like being in another world. So calming with the added music and sound effects. Glad to come across something like this. 🙂
McTruce ZAK : WOW! WOW! WOW! Alto's Adventure WOW!, i just got the game and I'm already impressed, the sounds and the game play! Just awesome 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 i thank y'all for your creativity and hard work. KEEP IT UP!
Dhan Macedo : Amazing! Such a great experience playing this game. Relaxing, and Zen mode is great to get yourself out of the competition mindset
Rich R0b : The game is very good but it is literally ski Safari with improved graphics, mechanic for mechanic it is exactly the same, game is good but I think feel like it's stolen
Yemi Fowosire : Such an iconic game I love it a and the funny thing about it is that whenever I delete it or reset my phone I always end up back to it. Ive played this game so many time yet it never disappoints
Mr. Frank : WHY does the game slow down when jumping over chasms? It's the same on PC and Mac. It's sometimes just impossible to reach the other side which makes this calm game so infuriating. The in app purchases are also a joke.
Samih Hayes : Beautiful Game! It would be good if you could save your progress like in Alto's Odyssey.

Max Sux : if ur gna give me an option to watch an ad to extend my run and i say no, dont force me to watch an ad anyway. if i knew u were just gonna force me to watch an ad, i would have just done it on my own and extended my run rather than just sit there and watch an entire ad for nothing at all. if ur gonna force me to sit through an ad when i already said no, just extend my run time because that would have just happened anyway AND youd still get the same amount of money
