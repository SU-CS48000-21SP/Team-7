if only you can meet up with people that you met in the part right after the starting bit but other wise it's a good game update(i if you can now but when i played you could not),0
this game is very calm and amazingly fun to play  i already enjoyed myself playing this game for a minute or two. i reall recommend people to play this game. it has nice graphics you get to see other players and unlock friendship and you get to explore other worlds.,1
i can't open my sky because it crashes everytime i open it after update  please fix it fast devs! since feb 24 and i didn't even recieve compensation.,0
omg! this game is awesome i play everyday continuosly for 3 hour. this game have fantastic story with high graphics & music .,1
fun to play with friends and nice sceneries but  the video recording button in-game doesn't work on android(with clean scenery like ios),1
beautiful graphics. cute stuff. but struggle to get a lots of heart and candles  bcz need to farming,1
very entertaining and fun to play through. you're able to make goals to save up for capes and there's seasons that last up to 2-3ish months at a time with daily missions to earn candles. there's a huge amount of emotes and socializing with other players is easy and fun. you can hold hands with other players and sit on their shoulders. the story is really charming and the customization is great!!,1
this is the most beautiful game i've played in my life. it brings me a sense of inner peace and every world makes my soul sing with joy. the music is great  the animation is magnificent  the flying mechanics are easy to learn  and the story itself feels like something out of a whimsical fairy tale. this is definitely a game you should play if you want to escape the stress of the real world.,1
plsss fix your game i cannot enjoy playing anymore because the game won't run smoothly in my mobile phone device and i can't enjoy the game anymore... it's so sad because i like this game but can't enjoy it plsss fix it,0

i love this game so so much!! though the bugs are frustrating  i don't really care that much hahahahaha,1
5 star game  the graphics and story is amazing and i love the whole vibe of it  but after a while it's repetitive  i only get on to grind  there's no more joy in exploring and it's just boring   i wish there was more to do then just grind for candles but it's still an amazing game,1

this is a very relaxing game with beautiful graphics  music  and story.,1
if you want to have a relaxing time playing an adventure game with cute items and graphic i highly recommend,1
very beautiful game! although there some slip-ups with the flying  but i enjoy it overall!,1
this game is my new favorite! i love it so so much there are some minor bugs but otherwise it is awesome!!,1
i like the game because it's really amazing. because all those ghosts and new upgrades winging powers.,1
greatest game everrr!!! there are no bugs the graphics are grea,1
such good graphics very good detailed game really interesting makes you feel very concentrated and its quite peaceful and relaxing,1
tried to sign up  but the game is having server issues. y'all need to upgrade lol,0
this is an amazing game.. it can calm down a person a lot and the soothing music of it is amazing..,1
"this is a masterpiece  a game unlike anything else. it blows my mind that a mobile game could be so good. first of all is 100% free  +no ads this just shows how much passion and love was put to this game! the graphics and the music are just breathtaking it could easily be a pc or console game. plus the ""social features"" add a whole other level to this game. it is heavy tho and poor devices will lag a lot. for me the lag is minimal but still there  tho i would be surprised if it wasn't.",1
its absolutely breathtaking. you want art and relaxation? this is it. honestly i've never seen a 3d game a cinematic as this one. everything looks so good. so far the theme is also intriguing. now for the controls  they are still a bit hard to manipulate for precise maneuver. and theres a sort of co-op component  but communication is really hard. i hope they set a friend system so.,1
this game is a masterpiece. the music  graphic  gameplay  story are all great and even better when combined together  i recommend everyone to give it a try. however there are still some issues,1
a masterpiece. the graphics are stunning  each frame of gameplay looks cinematic. i also like the interaction that you can have with other players. cons ,1
absolutely love this game! the graphics and music are amazing and the storyline is captivating 100/100 update,1
i love it! this game is incredibly well made; from the stunning graphics to the overall game play  sky,1
the game gas great graphics  it's probably one of the best i've played on mobile. i only have one problem,1
start with the major downsides. you can't play with your iphone friends. there are bugs that leads to losses of an extremely limited resources which you cannot recover. else,0
this is game is so cute and aesthetic ,1
i do like the graphics  cool character outfits and all the expressions. it's a sooth and relaxing game. there are still many things to do with friends even though you explore the whole map  reborn many times  got alot of candles and start fooling around with the dragon and all. overall  it's a nice game. but i noticed that the price of some specific items keeps raising across time  not affordable(with my condition). it would be lovely if they were cheaper. ,1
a beautiful game  it has a heartfelt environment and immersive gameplay. edit,1
one of the best mobile games i have played so far. really well executed. the gameplay evokes a sense of mystery and exploration. you get to meet players from world over and there is a sense of cooperation and helping each other out which is great. at times one does feel a little lost but then it feels like a part of the game. nothing pushing you to rush anywhere yet you want to explore more and more. thank you for this. and guess what  no ads... ,1
it was a fun game to experience and explore but the storyline is really lacking. it very hard to interpret what the story is. the controls are not as tight with flight being very hard to steer at times. it's not made clear that once you get to edan  it's a total restart. you loss all your wings. there really isnt a reason to continue playing once you reach the end because it's just a repeat of a short game with cosmetics for your character. it's very beautiful and the music is amazing.,1
4.5/5 the game controls are fairly well developed - there are occasional glitches that occur but nothing that takes away from the overall experience. the quests keep you on your toes but sometimes it can be a chore... i'm still rather invested in the game because the visuals are absolutely fantastic and i would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys discovery-type games!,1
great music  great controlls. the reason i deducted the stars are  story is ambiguous. no voice-overs  no story  not sure what to do  not sure where to go  monsters!! really?? in this game! worlds are good  customization is limited. i give you 100 points for effort and music composition. looking forward to more games from you.,1
the game is a bit glitchy when flying and avoiding rocks in eden which makes it hard to control or get away fast. had a few problems with certain gates not downloading and had to re-install the game quite a few times for it to eventually work. lovely story! i'll definitely keep playing it. enjoyed playing journey on the ps4 so hopefully this game will also be added to the playstation store sometime in the future.,0
probably the best mobile game you'll find right now  minimal to no ads  really good graphics and beautiful sound design. sometimes you don't know what's going on and that's the beauty of it  it reminds me of journey  you may not know where you're going but the places you visit along the way are amazing. the only real 'problem' is that there's a tiny bit of lag and the graphics go down for budget phones  but with a game as ambitious as this  that's only expected,1
"fantastic game honestly. there's something for everyone. sky has puzzles  exploration  both peaceful and exciting moments  mystery and intrigue  lovely music and beautiful open maps on which to play. the best part is that even after ""completing"" the game  there's still more fun to be had what with periodic events. occasionally things get a bit buggy but these issues are mild  temporary  and largely overshadowed by the game's appeal. it really is a game for all different types of people.",1
not to complicated. good quality game. with easy and difficult levels.,1
this game is amazing and i love it.it has a very nice vibe to it i wonder what happened to badland2 anyone remember it?if you can bring back the game it would be appreciated,1
exceptional experience  real and good fun  definitely worth the price. a few minutes of joy with friends and family is priceless,1
it's very entertaining and all  but the ads get on my nerves! honestly!!!,1
love it. boy it makes me laugh and same times i want to launch my tab . perfect lol,1
absolute trash can  you can only play like 20 levels out of 400 and then the rest you have to pay nearly five dollars...,0
i used to play this all the time with family and we loved playing it. over all the game is perfect and awesome.,1
i really like this game  it had so many ways to be the best like theres a lot of strategizing involved  that being said it's really good overall good job,1
tooooo many ads. i cant enjoy this game without being asked to pay after every level.,0
play a game  lose a match  had to watch ads forcefully....ads with 30 seconds without skip,0
when you pay to remove ads  it actually removes all ads. kudos.,1
it has amazing graphics. i need badaland 2 3 4 5 6 etc . i am waiting for more levels nd graphics,1
simple stunning graphics  simple stunning controls  simply perfect gameplay,1
too many traps. stuck at the lasts level. only the developer can win this game.,0
its a realy hood game,1
i loved this game a lot... it's a single player and single finger game but this game is just unbelievable... everyone must try this game....,1
the most family friendly game even with so many deaths involved. forever best game~,1
badland is very nice game i recommend you also download this game and play this game graphics is insane and the controls are pretty challenging,1
creative and clever level design. simple fun with beautiful visuals and rich atmosphere,1
love this game.. frustrating as hell  but love it for it..,1
there are too many add while playing the game. overall game experience is good but adds ruin it totally,0
there are to many ads in this game  its either watch all these ads or buy our premuim  you dont want our premium? well watch these ads then.,0
there's like 4 levels unless you upgrade to premium sucks and was a waste of time,0
im not one to criticize ads but seriously at least let me exit out  if the ads are gonna be that frequent let people exit out. please fix it,0
this game is amazing. i had it a while back on my old phone and the atmosphere along with just a fun game makes this overall great,1
maybe i'm missing something but with no controller it doesn't play well. also it was a bit boring.,0
i am so glad that i already played and finished this game years ago when these people were not greedy for money..... your ads suck.,0
osam i like this game so much ..its a very good game i had ever plaid .... thanku thos who made this game.. the graphic was so beautyfull and i like the beautyfull back ground sound ...,1
one of the best two players i've ever played good control and graphics,1
full of lag and bug   specially on lazers. my phone is galaxy s10 it doesnt have any problem but on this game my phone get freezed o dont know whats the probleb but i hope they fix it beacause its great game.,0
too much ads and you can't even skip them,0
you can not get any achievements on google play games unless you are connected to internet! and when you are connected to the internet badland becomes ad-land!,0
it is vary fun and i like how you can make your own and over all it is a good game.,1
this is my childhood. game soo i want it too try again and it was still fun as always,1
ads!! if there wasnt ads so often it would be perfect.,0
too much ads every time i die there's a 15 second ad and i'm not that good so its annoying,0
amazing game. love the graphics  gameplay  and aesthetic.,1
this game is worth the size of 100+ mb its feel veary good whike playing it  and i'm running on 833.3mb ram tablet and its amazing  keep the work up creators!,1
brilliant nice very hard for everyone but if you try this game then you feel like the game is easy  so try it,1
best game ever...too hard but too good... just wonderful... i installed 6-7 games but i didn't like them...but i am really impressed by this game...superb...,1
a very good game but too much ads but it is a very good game after all it is the free version,1

just takes me to a black screen where i can't do anything but listen to the main menu music,0
i absolutely love it  as well as me and my brother can play it together and we are always having so much fun and laugh!,1

this game is amazing great graphics levels and really fun to play keep up the good work,1
i love this game so much the quality is amazing and the levels get harder and harder i play this game every day and never get bored! great jod developer it is amazing,1

perfect couch multiplayer game  with support of multiple controller on a single phone.,1
this is a very good game if you considering to buy the full game you should.,1
unique and very interesting game + challenging,1
i like the game very much the smootheness of graphics is superb.keep going developers.,1
this game is exceptional it's simple calm and relaxing it's a distressor and a anxiety releaser.,1
addictive game if you have been a fan of classic flappy bird. this feels like flappy bird 50.0,1
i really like the forest and the adventure in the game in the unknown creatures it really brings out the name of the game badland,1
this game is great i can get frustrated at times but once you beat it then you just have to move on to the next,1
badland was an amazing experience. me and my so have spent many days playing this fantastic game in co op on our nvidia shield,1
it is very very hard game super game i only completed day one it should be game of the year and it is not like pubg it's multiple super,1
cool but u need to pay for playing other days and u cant play multiplayer or world levels because of that ads,0
this is one of the first mobile games i've ever played  and it still holds up years later. definitely earned my money,1
four long adds between each lvl  would have been a good game but completely ruined by adds,0

nice game it is really fun no ads so i rate it 5 stars,1
worstest app ever  never install this app. only adds are there . play 1 minute and get 4-5 long adds without skip option worstest app,0
i have had this game for about 10 min now. and i haven't been able to play it. honestly  it's because of ads.,0
the game is so lagging that from the upper levels it lags so much that one time i thought that my phone had just totally wasted.,0
best game ever played just love this.graphics are astonishing and also its amazing with earphones.,1
i hate all of the ads and stuff you have to watch every time you finish level,0
many ads and all of them take 30 seconds. thats too much.,0

ads is horrible. unplayable. too bad it's a good game,0
the game is full of ads..& becoming very much irritating.worst thing in any application or game,0
too many ads. advertised on other apps 3 a week charge to play this,0
worst game ever. whenver i try to play it shows me to upgrade to premium and then close the game.,0
its ok for group play but they should really make the solo levels more interesting and way more harder,1
l love this app soo much! but since when did you add true co-op and since when was there build a level?!? i am a old player,1
so addictive i've played it all day & i've finished all levels it's a fun game & great graphics,1
when i was younger i would play this like crazy! and i think i should get it again for fun,1
simple  alive  easy to learn hard to master  this game time well spent,1

it is a great game and things are so cute four players can play in it good graphics,1
i keep getting a bug where when i start playing everything beckmes echoed and it ruins the sound,0
it's so inspiring and beautiful of some people's lifestyle like mine it is fit exactly and made for me to play thanks creator,1
a little strange story  amazing graphics  really. if you haven't played it yet  you really should (also i'm really glad that theres level creator),1
an ad after every stage. more time with an ad than playing.,0
very good game  runs smoothly with no bugs and the art style is beautiful,1
i love this game it's so cool!!!! because i only love it and my friends always die and i gave five (5) stars and littrely so funny play it now like 1000 persent i realy love it do you love it? then play it! i hope you love it!!!,1
it's unusual and strangely alluring. .....i like the graphics.,1
the worst app ever it gives advertising every minute the worst please don't download   you'll regret it.,0
very fun and challenging. but it has alot of ads though,1
too much adds. please consider those on paid mobile plans without wifi access.,0
ads in every level was so annoying so i uninstalled it... i hate this game thank you,0
everywhere i look there's just ads and ads and more ads!!!!!,0
good game  simple  nice graphics and good gameplay.,1
ads are unnecessarily frustruating i watch ads more than i play the actual game.,0
beautifully crafted world. challenging and engaging to play.,1
i don't care about the ads i think it is a great game which is different to anything else i have played before,1
this game is so amazing! my friends are laughing and we enjoy the game and the hard levels,1
too many ads in this game which doesn't worth the money aking for premium version,0
i think this is a great game it is so chill the graphics are so good it is a really good game i love the background noise,1
really cool and addictive. the sound effects are spectacular,1
amazing graphics and awesome sounds. addictive and highly recommend,1
combines elements from many of my previous favourite games. play is so cleaverly addictive!,1
its quite delicious and appetizing  contains some nice ingredients and looks good,1
amazing art  and a great time killer. i higly reccomend this game.,1
it is a nice game but there are some levels that have no logic it is super unique game,1
love the level designer .also i really like the graphics.,1
it was such an amazing game that tested your brain. definetly a game worth getting.,1
always shows the annoying message to upgrade to premium   this game is greedy,0
theres not much to say  its just the best indie game i have ever played! so many levels!( )!,1
it's a fantastic adventure with a great level editor! and it's all free!,1
an ad after each attempt at a level! come on!,0
too much ads  this game is more like advertisement. com,0
i finished all the one player free levels. it was a good experience,1
stop trying to force me to buy the premium version and i've only been playing a game for 10 mins.,0
i'm rating 1 bc it just none stop ads if i say no to whach a vid for a skin it still makes me whach it just no prize fix it,0
awesome graphics  i rly love this soundtrack   its amazing   i sz this game!!,1
one of the bestest game i have played ever...a mysterious sound effects....full of.silence and peace....what a game great...,1
great app!! as i was seeing the ad some game pop up in my phone nice concept of watching ad.,1
screen movement goes too fast before i can get my guy unstuck  please fix the screen move bug,0
destroyed what was once a very good game with adverts...uninstalled.,0
challenging and relaxing  really brings out the satisfaction of survival,1
i love this game so much they did a great job on the game concept but the best thing about this game is the level maker,0
amazing! i'm 8 years old   love the style and sound effects.,1
that's an awesome game right there love the visual everything is just beyond brilliant,1
it's good because u can play with your friends on the same divice and you can play on co-op,1
best game out there. beautiful graphics and control.,1
a very nice game but please add online multiplayer in it to make it the best game in the world,1
absolutely brilliant game but over time its get to difficult to collect more clones,1
too many adds  they make a good game completely annoying and unplayable,0
it's a very good game. i really enjoyed and loved playing the game and i am very much entertained... keep it up,1
this is so fun and tricky! i enjoyed a lot. it's just amazing thanks for the game dev,1
great graphics and sounds. very entertaining!,1
i remember plaing this game at a phone store  but when i got my phone i did not remember the name  of the game so now i found it.,1
just amazing  there art is so cute  plus   the app works perfectly!,1
it sucks that i have to play an ad after every level. disgusting,0
great gameplay. would be better if it had a storyline.....,1
literally played this for ages and finished it a few times and i think it's addicting too and i love it ,1
this game is not good when am trying to play it says badland has stopped. like b i want to play.,0

having a lot of fun  addicting good for spending spare time,1
it's a great game. i would give 5 stars but controlling is very bad,1
pretty fun game. the progression is at a good pace and the graphics are cute. i also like the multi-touch to split group.,1
not a bad little game! if you're a d and d fan! new gamers probably won't like this game! if you grew up on atari and intellivision! it's perfect!,1
i'm not bluffing but this is probably the most fun i've had playing a game ever if u don't download ur missing out on a lot of fun!,1
a totally addictive game.if you are bored because of old games then give it a try.you'll not be bored,1
addicting! this is what i call a unique and smart game. there's nothing like this on the store!,1

needs a better way to level up,0
good game with cool tactical gameplay,1
rating prompts after less than 10 minutes playing = 1*,0

simple  and engaging game that you can play anywhere without data. what can i say. its perfect,1
awesome and super amusing game. funky and appealing graphics. really gets you emerged in a simple fashion.,1

it's a good game grate graphics and very nice control's this game is so fun,1
awesome tap button rpg. i have enjoyed thus far.,1
i always wanted a strategy game on the phone  this is a real time  very basic strategy game with puzzle elements,1
a great concept but it doesn't use the formation mechanic nearly enough.,0
great game but too many ads.... like to play some more games like this,1

this is the best puzzle game . i loved it . it is somewhat different and unique from other games . i have faced some difficulties and problems while making your own card overall it is the best,1
small standalone puzzles  no time limit for solving the puzzles  good game controls  i found it both challenging and not repetitive in nature,1
this game is just absolutely cool! i mean  good graphic  great music  simple gameplay (but brain-teasing). awesome  absolutely awesome!,1
i like this game a lot but in some levels you can't move character to the spot the want it to also most of the the levels are hard and confusing to figure out please fix this,0
simple. relaxing. well designed. i especially love the way the background music syncs to your touch inputs.,1
its a very satisfying and challenging puzzle type of game  and it also runs very smooth  im hoping for more levels and features in the future ,1
i got stressed out how to complete the puzzle but that's what it got to be more thriller  also i really love the background music  it relaxes my ear.,1

challenges short but very well constructed. graphics simple but captivating. great game. second time that i played something from this dev. will follow his next works.,1
fun little game. smooth gameplay and nice graphics. ads aren't interruptive. the game is free but you can pay as much as you want.,1
for less than 5mb you're getting a decent game. puzzles will keep you going and the game loads fast and is very smooth. this was my second time downlpading this because i finished it the first time.,1
good time pass  i still think it needs more improvements  like it takes a lot of time to move  which is a little annoying after sometime.,0
the artwork is enticing with a chearful aftertaste  and the design layout is creatively alluring. i look forward to playing and am super happy to have discovered this gem. thank you!,1
i love this game a lot! the robot is so cute to walk around and it makes me went jeehhdusisooaodbxnxmxbbanaj. the ads not really bother me that much than the other game which is cool. the puzzles are a bit tricky and entertaining  keep it up a good work developers! ,1
well playing it is fun and more fun is creating your own level. it would be more fun if that created levels we could share to our firends and challenge them. also time specific level should also be added thanks a lot to the developer and team,1
beautiful graphics. charming little droid. it's a great game to forget about your troubles for a time with a little challenge on the side.,1
this game is so cute and pleasant! and some of the hard levels make your brain work like crazy  and thats what i like in puzzle games. thank you for making such a nice one,1
really challenging and amaxing way to pass the time but not waste it. really top notch puzzle game. thanks for making it.,1
this is the best game. it is challenging and entertaining at the same time. this game is a full pack with calming music  tough levels & has dunking the ball level too. this is a very genuine game i shall recommend it to everyone i know.,1
this is the most beautifully implemented game of its genre that i have seen in many years. quite delightful to play!,1
the robot and its movements are adorably cute! the person who designed the background music and made it play according to the users' clicks is a genius.,1
easy gameplay. cool graphics. overall awesome puzzle game and the interface is awesome. the best is thing is there is no ads.,1
gameplay is simple  but the puzzle solving is satisfying if a tad repetitive. amazing graphics  simple controls.,1
this is just awesome. no ads only fun. neat and clean. this game is the benchmark where every other game needs to reach. no personal data asked for. no sign in required. just play. and yes efforts taken should be appreciated.,1
its a good game for time pass and it increases our memory power to think in different ways to win the game .not only for game it is use full for our lifes too.it helps us to learn how overcome our problems by ourselfs with the help of blocks(friends ) and to finally win the game thankyou for making this game mekorama i heartfully thank every one who did hard work for making this game success note,1
one of the best relaxing and mind intutive apps i've ever seen ...cool graphics...no frustrating timers...no advertisment...and the best of all the developer lets you to decide how much money you want to pay/donate,1
amazing ! the game is so fun to play  it is challenging and at the same time not frustrating! i love the graphics as well!!,1
really love this game  one issue,1
i love the game.. i usually give up playing these kinda games. but mekorama is just difficult to give up on.. i mean.. i just don't feel like giving up till i solve it.. n it also helps in our thinking skills.. n all.. overall i loved the game..,1
it's a real nice 'idea' behind this game and graphics are so nice. it's a kind of game which keep you bound with it. and finally the work of developers is admirable.,1
this is really a good game! i finished all of the 50 levels and i'm proud. th levels was hard  but finally i could solve this.. if you love challenging yourself.. you should try this game. it's addictive and frustating.. wkwk.,1
the graphic and artstyle of the game is classical and nice . fun and creative gameplay. best game for those who like puzzle type games . great time killer.,1
very nice cool interesting and of course very much difficult... the starting levels are very easy but as levels increase the difficulty of the game also increases very nice brain game,1
i like the fact that you can design your own levels and scan the one's others have made it means you can never truly finish the game.,1
so cute! being able to rotate the camera more to see different angles might help a little but its definitely worth playing! its nice that its free  too.,1
this game is totally amazing . i love this game . i completed all the levels and now i am playing community level . they are most amazing . but add more levels and elements . and you can continue the levels in other planets,1
"i like it. martin magni  your game is one of the top 10 physical games and i have a letter for you. ""dear martin magni  mekorama is a good game  i know that a little bot needs to go back to the planet he's traveling  and i can help finish the game... but i couldn't pass the following levels",1
excellent! i don't normally do reviews but this game is awesome. the puzzles get you thinking and for the space it takes up in your drive it is excellent. and it is free!,1
it's cute. idk why i love it   it doesn't eating so much storage in my phone   and the gameplay is entertaining   just like i'm bored or waiting someone   i have this game to be played while waiting . the puzzle and the cute robot it's what i like from his game  thanks for making this game developer,1
game is a great time killer and really appreciate the logic in every level. the higher the level the hardest it is to finish.,1
best game in a long time!! i flipping love this game! challenging  quirky & addictive there's 1 level i can't finish due to my tiny phone screen. but otherwise a phenomenal game.,1
it is good game but when player enters in room or something like that the outer structure should become transparent so that we can see inside structure plus there should be more camera rotations and brief description written with name of levels,0
giving this one star since i literally can't rate it. why? damn thing won't even open. i click it both from the app store and my home page  it just opens to the developer name  then stops. when i go to running apps it doesn't even say it's running. might help to make your game uhm  actually open long enough for game play?,0
the design and animations are amazing. the developer is very skilled. buuuut  there is no challenge at all.,1
the game is absolutely addictive once you get a feel for it. the controlls are simple and smooth with a simple objective in the game.,1
delightful game which is beautifully made and a nice balance between challenging but relaxing. great design and ad free  easily worth paying for!,1
i absolutely love this game. great visual and gameplay also love the ui. i almost never get bored playing this game. i really appreciate the developer for making this game. surely would try to support them. highly recommended.,1
amazing game the graphics   the music and the mechanics the only thing that needs improving is the fact that the bot doesn't return inside of the maze when it accidentally flies away from it,1
this game is very enjoyable even though it's not very challenging. it's similar to monument valley  so if you enjoyed that game  you will like this as well. i appreciate the relaxing nature of this game. it functions well and you can tell that the devs put forth a lot of love creating this. very nice job!,1
this is the best puzzle game ever. i will never delete this game. i recommend all humans old / young to download this game. i write this review because i can't pay  sorry martin magni.,1
this game is kinda wasted potential. this could be as popular as gd if he keep updating it and if he were really serious with it. this game still fun  but its just your clasic 2016 mekorama  really nothing new this game editor really simple and doesn' t require you to have at least 80 in logic  it just you  your hamd and creativity. that it if magni is releasing mekorama 2 im sure everyone will exited about it,1
this was the best game app i have ever played. this is really a challanging app. it forces you to think in a logical manner. its graphics are really brilliant at very less mb. i recommend everybody who likes to play some brainstorming games to download this app.,1
so simple yet difficult (several times) to reach the spot. and the buildings are beautiful. nice game to take a break and pass the time.,1
a fun game that has you solving puzzles  the robot is cute  some are quite challenging and frustrating but you keep on coming back for more,1
"it's very nice game. this game needs so much brain sometimes to solve a puzzle that i start getting feeling that this game is challenging me and saying ""solve this if you have enough nerves""",1
brilliant game  fun  smooth  well designed and executed. plus no annoyances or grinding. needs to be more games like this.,1
lovely game! levels are just challenging enough to be fun without being frustrating. i'd love to support the creators financially  but money is a little tight right now. ,1
perfect game... makes you think a lot and doesn't really give you a free pass. you have to pay for hints and which i think is smart.,1
the game mekorama let me tell you guys that i don't know where to start. simple to put this is that it's challenging and needs more levels. i would love to see more games out there like this one,1
i love this game. the style is so cute and the puzzles are so interesting and the little stumble that the robots do when you move something too fast makes me feel bad.,1
i don't have the money to give you but this is a super game. that the player can create the game. awesome experience. small app but really intresting game i recommended to all of my friends,1
a must play. edit,1
wow! this one is an awesome puzzle with the best mini 3d lego look alike. love to play it. keep up the good works  dev. ,1
the puzzle are good but some of is not especially when clicking inside a building. you cant move inside. and also the camera angles should be free  not fixed.,0
it is a very nice games and it's main character is also so cute and the thing that gave it five stars is that is has a feature to build your own level and it is only of 9 mb .wow so much fun only for 9 mb. the game is much better than any 30 to 40 mb games so i really really recommend you but i should give my opinion to the company that you should have given an gmail log in so that our progress remains to ourself if the games is deleted by chance that happened to me . thanks for this cool game.,1
this game makes me comfortable... it makes my stress gone and satisfying motions and smoothness... and less mb and no ads supports.. i love it for real.. even it makes me confuse but still i learned alot of strategies...,1
kudos to the developer for such a game...which is simple to understand but complex to solve at the same time. demands out of the box thinking and creativity to solve levels. what a gameplay. (p.s. pls add new levels soon. ),1
excellent. game  design  music and execution. simple but intriguing. ads are not annoying at all.,1
i actually like this game  since it's had a good graphics  but i don't like the view  it's not flexible  i hope he fixed it on next update..,0
what a wonderful graphics. absolutely challenging  fun  addictive and friendly game. and big thanks there's no ads in this. thanks for making this  martin.,1
love it  awesome puzzles (kind of 3d) some easy some hard. you can build your own puzzles and play other people puzzles (big bonus in my opinion  people make great puzzles). very recommend!!,1
this is a wonderful little game. simple puzzles with some lovable little robots. highly recommend and even paid for it on my wife's account. worth every penny!,1
worst controls in this or any other world's games dammed controls are so frustrating. i have been level 28 trying for more than half a year....... please fix this issue ...,0
i like this game. this game is really excellent. it is quite simple with mind-blowing graphics. after level 27 it become quite hard.,1
i love this game so much!! this game is so challenging and fun! i haven't found any bugs so far  the ads aren't annoying and the design is so cute! the developers of this game deserve five stars,1
i love it  the graphics and all but one thing i wanted an update that has wide world so i can place block more and then make a new items too like doors chairs ect thats all like if you want this update,0
the game is simple and yet has powerful graphics which doesn't seem like it. it would be great if you can show the number of stars in the game on the screen above hint icon. i have to pause the game and check for the number of stars there.,0
i love this game! it's just great like hopeinggo always says it's great because it's great. anyway i give it 5/5 it's a really fun game you can make your own level it's just great i even made a captain toad level,1
totally dumb game. no tutorial  no video of how it's gonna work. just a block and have to go throw it with no jump animation either. either keep watching ads to get same hint again and again or pay money to get subscription,0
seconds into the game it's already stopped working. every time i swipe to move the platform  the whole diorama moves instead. there's no way to differentiate commands.,0
this game was 4mb as far as i remember with same excellent graphic back then when i used to play 6 years back. 10mb yet with all the updates these years is impressive. reinstalled it  got fine memories with it.,1
relaxing  peaceful and i get to take my time?? followed by really great graphics and simple controls? and i get to feel smarter? you've had my curiosity  but you now have my attention. bravo  devs!,1
a nice  chill game that requires a bit of logical flexing and some sharp eyes. it's fun still to revisit levels you're done with. thanks  martin!,1
i have been playing this for a long time and this is one of the best puzzle games i've ever played and even better because you can build your own levels!! anyways happy new year!!!,1
games that need your brain work more. good games  but sometimes its hard for move when the character inside the building,0
i really love the game. very addictive  cute and funny. no ads  only fun. i greatly recommend if you like puzzle games.,1
an absolutely adorable little bot. i don't normally review apps but this is so different than anything else i've played  very well made and worth sitting down in your free time to play,1
it's a good game but i found a really funny glitch in level 8. you have to tell the robot to go to a circle and when he's almost touching it lift it up very fast doing this will push the robot out of the map but good game,0
very unique game and new concept. every level is kind of new challenge. i had to uninstall this game because my kid was addicted to this.,1
its awsome because you can build some things and you can tap the master button if you want to play hard level's this was an amazing game keep it up,1
a fantastic game that makes my brain think..... each level is different in its own way........love the game.... hope to get additional levels........,1
really good game puzzling mind i have made many level . can you please tell me how to register my level .? give new author chance to register whose ever level is best you think. also give reward to new author. hopes  you will think on it at last really interesting game,1
amazing puzzles. gets difficult progressively. love the music in background it's so relaxing as well so,1
great  smart game. not much ads. gear  funny characters. nice gameplay and interesting and sometimes funny levels,1
best lite weight game with amazing graphics and realy mindboggling puzzles. it must be topping the charts..,1
i cannot upload my levels due to qr code decompression. i don't know why but if i compare my level's qr code to other levels  my level's code is tightly packed into a medium-size square  unlike the other level's code which literally fills up the entire qr code box. please fix this issue.,0
good game  too time consuming  after a quick teabreak game. suits kids  not for me. takes too long to load! not for me. refund my expensive uk data at 80mb for 2 plays now! time wasting. deleted asap! cute graphics! 2/1/22. uk review,0
wow this game is of only 10 mb then alo so many great physics and graphics it is having and very smooth add free and bug free game i loved ur work but  you should add multiplayer to it so it could be great thing pllzzzzzzzzzzz.........,1
very creative gameplay experience. well thought out. not a cheap money grab like so many other games.,1
phenomenal game! very addicting and challenging. minimal ads. you must download this.,1
awesome little game to get your brain thinking. great graphics. easy to control.,1
great  fun puzzle game. the levels are well thought and challenging.,1
really good and relaxing game. good graphics  cute characters and challenging. gives the option for u to pay any amount you want,1
plays great and looks great. cunning  ingenious puzzles. the occasional ads aren't intrusive or annoying at all.,1
the best ever game. music is relaxing. game is smooth interesting and you need out of box thinking abilities. i just loved it.,1
best puzzle game i've ever played. the game has good 3d graphic and very challenging  that's how a puzzle is supposed to be. nice,1
interesting game but robots are difficult to control through a maze. i stopped playing when the fun stopped. couldn't finish nor want to try again.,0
this game is really mind boggling. it's very simple yet brilliantly designed to include it's complexity within the simplicity. mr. melodrama  the cute little robot's movements are extremely natural and childish. i sometimes felt sad for abusing him to finish the game. anyway this game makes you think deeply. it evokes the thinker in you.,1
this game is both cute and challenging! it also allows you to skip a level if you get stuck. very well-designed game!,1
what a cute and beautiful game. it is amazing and addictive. need i say more. very simple though could get tricky once a while. a game worth wasting your time on,1
yay  25 new levels. and the irrtating static view has changed so i can navigate 360. thanks martin for this amazing game. the music is the best part ,1
very challenging puzzle levels. even more challenging 3d puzzle builder mode. and sharing created levels with other users! well done.,1
awesome game! such a cute character. early levels are quite easy but the game gradually gets both more challenging and more addictive!,1
what a wonderful outstanding game!! it's so sure that this will mess with everybody's brain. i'm sure that you have made an extraordinary effort to develop this. truly amazing. i give my extraordinary congrats to you. keep it up. looking forward to mekorama 2....,1
absolutely brilliant! not boring. no bothersome ads. martin you did great! keep it up. very entertaining. no puzzle unbeatable  but not easy either,1
i like this game  it's relaxing  not time consuming. i can play it while rest my feet  and the music...aahh it's simple but give me back my good mood,1
a great way to pass time   it's has nice graphics and awesome gameplay. i suggest buying premium to get a hint when it's too hard.,1
this game is great! it's a fun little puzzler with excellent sound design. it's worth trying out to listen to the music alone.,1
as the level of this game increses  difficulty level as well as curiosity increses. interesting logical game. one more thing about this game is that if you want a hint to solve any level you will have to pay 30inr  50inr  100inr & so on. if you are not able to pay then  no problem you won't proceed if you like the game you can write a review  wow ! what an idea sir ji ! i suggest this game.,1
simply the best mobile game ever. no exaggeration. challenges one to think creatively. and shout out to the creative efforts that went into the app's design motif  consistent fluid feel and just the entire experience. hands down martin magnificent is a g  see what 25years of mastering your craft brings forth. ,1
the game is quite interesting as well as engrossing. the levels are well designed and provide with challenges to overcome. loved it!,1
this is an awesome game. it is challenging but not impossible and the graphics are enchanting and readable. l highly recommend this game.,1
i love the way this game challenges my brain to solve it but one issue is that it's impossible to scan the tiny qr codes when i make my own levelsso i can send them to my friend for testing othe than that its amazing,0
best game to pass time. they even gave built in simulator. it's awseome . i loved this game  suggestion,1
it's an awesome game! my kids love solving each puzzle and driving meko to the red dot. it's such a lovely character!,1
fun  difficult but doable  pleasing 3d graphics. cleverly thought out  small game to download  good have to go in and out of when there's time,1
one of the best brain teasers  the background music changes with patter of your click. thanks to the developer.. for not adding ads to it.,1
maze solving with verticality. a very entertaining and engaging game with apt sounds. a very good blend of the concepts. this is the game that i usually recommend to my friends. kudos to the developer.,1
martin. you've done a great job with this game. the fact that you let us play it for free and then left it to us to determine it's value is incredible. i have never seen any developer do this and it's nothing short of brilliant. you obviously worked hard on this game and judging from the love it's gotten it paid off! congratulations! looking forward to your future projects.,1
the game isn't puzzling  it's fustrating. why would u make the character move involuntarily towards tazers and bots. it's borderline annoying. also stop asking for money so frequently. did u want the game to be free for everyone to play or did u think it wasn't worth paying for? just label a price on the app store or add a place to donate for it.,0
really having fun with this. great art style. fun  challenging puzzles. but lowkey and casual. i love it!,1
loved this game alot  completed a couple of times but still never got bored. eagerly waiting for next version...yeah i know we can download different levels from browser but still just waiting for more. do try this game guys you'll love it for sure.,1
the game's amazing....i have tried many games over time...and its one of the very good games' category that i would put this game in. it's not very addictive so won't kill ur precious time and it's fun...so overall....good games for everyone looking for a rest time game,1
i love it. its tricks the mind  but the music and beautiful simple graphic dilutes the pressure and make it such a soothing and refreshing game.,1
this game was good  it also has options for designing your own level  but you have to purchase the hints. that's the only drawback. overall a very cute game.,1
i could have given 5 star but some issues is found by me. we can't upload our levels in forums. after completing 3 levels it will show black screen and we again have to play that same level. these are only my issues please say me that how to upload our levels in forums. thank you!,0
this game us really nice... has a good graphics very simple concept i love the levels... it is easy at first and becomes tough at last... we can even create our own levels... it is a very simple but an intresting... funny... good timepase game... try this game it is really a cool game...,1
very nice  free and engaging puzzle game after a very long time. 50 levels only but very worth it. knocked it off in 1 day.... worth it,1
the robot is too  dang cute! wish i can hug it! the puzzles are challenging  but fun! and the sick update! nice one!,1
this game is 5*****. it keep me going and going. the programmer has done a fantastic job in creating the many many different fun and challenging level. well done.,1
i wonder if the developers have thought about trying this game in with lego... the game could be adapted and models actually built as sets... obviously the automation wouldn't be there but the possibilities would be endless just as with the game,1
very interesting...and tricky game... it's for all ages... the graphics is really so good...has to apply your brain...and it can help to develop the geometrical view,1
"too many ads  but fun idea. it asks that you allow ads ""sometimes"" but it's an ad after every level.",0
i find the game challenging. though at times frustrating  as it is unclear how to move certain pieces. but so far it has been intriguing.,1
i think it's an amazing game for it's like 6 mbs of data  the puzzles  the physics  the graphics are all awesome  definitely keeping this hidden gem on my new phone!,1
the game has a lot to do with our brain. it provides us puzzle-like experience. for 10mb  this is the best game that i would recommend.,1
little bit hard  the grapichs is good  me n my sis play this at hospital  n she's fun with this  but when we reach high level that w so harddd.... i cant understnd  but its worth it  i like it!,1
really interesting app with brain chllenging levels. if someone likes puzzles they should definately try this game once. the graphics are really great.,1
it might be relaxing for many people because a soft back ground music makes the game enjoyable but for me that experience lasted for some time only i got bored of the game quickly . still it was nice.,0
an utterly ridiculously awesome game. it's creative  intuitive and above all appealing to the eyes and ears. thank you for making this game.,1
good game i like it. you can build your own levels. i have a trick that you can make two rooms and say choose a room. one room will have zappers and other will have finish point. and trick your friends now!!!!,1
the game is really interesting and fun. it makes us think a lot to solve those puzzles. i really preffer this game if u like to solve puzzles.,1
i love this game. its so challenging and addictive. u can't find a better game than this that is this size. thr developer really put his effort into this. it's amazing. i showed my siblings and they are addicted to it. thumbs up,1
good game. i love it  the tiny robot is so cute  even my son and brother download it too! finally  after stuck for 3 days  i figured out to beat level 19! you're genius  martin! finished all the cards. the best game ever!,1
great graphics and animation. puzzles are challenging and not repetitive. good background sounds.,1
it's the best game ever like literally everyone is giving it 4 to 5 stars you should get i am so glad i got it! you have to go to play store and get it!but the only problem is that you can't play the levels you make only the ones the game provides you!,0
one of the best games ever created. easy controls  smooth working and interesting levels i love this game i finished it but i want to do more please update this best graphics too.,1
the game has been designed excellently. the game designer has done an excellent job here. the idea of the game is really innovative. the game is thought provoking . and unlike other games it is hardly 5mb. over all an excellent game.,1
very nice.i really enjoy with the puzzles. i can't make it at first.then i think and think at last i made it. thank you,1
very nice game could improve more in future by adding more in games like shooting or something more interesting to develop or reach through more audience also name it coming mekarama as 2.0 and so on just my opinion and thank you for creating a awesome app like this.. i be a coder i know how hard work your team put on this ..app..,1
i found the game back  installed when it was new after so many years i found it again. nostalgia.,1
this is probably the best mobile /tablet app game i have seen!!! excellent graphics with the cutest loveable character!!! simple to play and totally addictive. if i was employed and could afford it i'd happily support the developer!!!! absolutely marvellous!!!!!,1
this is totally a game worth playing. i'm also surprised by the developers hardwork put into it  the game is small in size  fun to play  ads are decent and not put on your face  and they constantly improve the game. good job.,1
this game is awesome you should definitely give it a try.. it tests your brain in such a cute way that you won't be able to figure it out.. also thanks for the developers who did it finely well.. i can't pay you so as you said to write a review.. this is the best game for me.. plus it is a promise that i'm never gonna uninstall this game.. please keep developing such games.. hope this helps you a lot..,1
the game is okay but why is it that some features are not working. an example is the vertical lifts how do you bring them down?,0
its a good brain roasting game . according to me and my known players this game should many of its bugs and unknown tricks should be told . and last but not the least a vertical orbit moving should also be involved in this game.,0
it would be useful and cool to add gears  sensors  sequenced  multiplayer  suspension  and timer thing.,0
love this! it is challenging and fun! the ads are brief so not that bad.,1
great game  the android doesn't follow directions 100%  but good puzzle game and very difficult,1
i have played this game n number of times and also remember this is more than 6 years old..i was bored so i downloaded this and i was really upset this has got those stars thing with was kinda annoying and the main this ads i have to watch a 7 sec or 5 sec after finishing each i am very disapointed with the ads the stars i had soo mad i litreally deleted the game i had played this from 2015 till 2018 and then today i downloaded and this much change i had to deleted one of my fav game so fast,0
it's a great game  i like to play this after stressful school time  even the background music is awesome. the best part is that you can even create your own level  amazing right?,1
these game is so intresting i want more level and martin magni you are really legend i have no words for you your game are inspiring me i used your these app 3yers ago and i complete all levels of these game and leave it but now it was change and you made it perfect all the best for you new games,1
okay no1,1
its a great game . i played the game 3 years ago now that i am getting it back i am regretting deleting it. tip,1
great game and great author. this is the kindest a game developer has ever been  that i don't have to pay for anything and i can just pay what i want for what it's worth. it's just great! all the other developers should be kind like you. thank you for this beautiful game,1
this was super cool to be honest. i like the game and so unique and easy app. i enjoy alot . thank you so much admin! i was looking for a game and this game was fun,1
it is a really great game but sometimes there are glitches in the game while editing . i can't pay for it (cuz i'm 11 years old )but it is my dream game i love it,1
the game is made very well but it has one drawback that is the screen also moves while using the lift.,0
i love how challenging it is and you can even make your own games  cause i have already made like three.,1
best game ever .... i love this game very much... the walk of that robot is very funny when the level increases the game is very difficult to play,1
interesting game. the builder is a plus. you can build your own levels. seems like this dev might have a good head on his shoulders,1
playing for the second time after 6 years  nothing much has changed which is fine by me because it's a perfectly balanced game.,1
best game. no bug . i love this game because we also build our levels and levels of this game are best . i suggest you to download this game .,1
clever and challenging game of logic with help when you need it. just about perfect,1
it is so muck exciting game. i think that i should give it 5 stars but aftee playing i consider that it's camera angle is not effective it should be changed like 3d angle avoiding only rotating it. we can't play with this camera angle change it.,0
the reason why i gave it 1 star is that in this game all levels should have a boundary best when i played one master level that is pinball always the ball goes outside the boundary which is very irritating,0
very nice game with unique features like ,1
simple concept  cute character  challenging mazes. not complicated  not boring. thank you for making this game.,1
touch interface is ridiculous. must have pressed twenty times on a target  and no response.,0
really amazing game and one of the best 3d puzzle games in the store  also the art style is really great and the option to create your own levels is great.,1
i enjoying this game and i can create a level too  ads that pop pup every where that not bother me. i love this game so much,1
a very good game it is fun and have challenging levels in this game we can create our own level and play it graphics game play and controls are very good and the robot is also very cute and it trains your brain it is a brain game and it is in only 5.4 mb so less space it takes on your mobile in amazing performance who likes puzzle games thus is the best game for them very good keep it up martin magni i am waiting for a new game or update nice kkep it up,1
it's a great game. stable application no ads no fancy items. clean ui. it's good to play when ur alone and good brain exercise.,1
i can't put it down the robot is easy to move while still being challenging and the navigation becomes trickier and trickier to get each level there is so much to think through i love it thank you,1
this game is fun especially when you can create hard levels your self. my one complaint is this wheel level that is impossible to beat for me. but its is still fun.,0
this is such a great little game! fun  challenging at times. great time filler. the work that must have gone into designing it  credit to them.,1
very creative idea of gaming and the challenging levels. and the most gamer thing about this game is you can create your own levels and can submit. brilliant... loved it...,1
its challenging  engaging  addictive and overall just a fun game. its definitely worth a download and basically have 0 complaints about it. it's a fun pass time!,1
there is 1 problem that i build level and when it is time to play it starts but after sometimes automatically it will cut off the game in between when i playing my own created level . i request you to please resolve this problem fast as you can and get your 5 back .,0
one of the best puzzle based game. nice design and short levels that's interesting and challenging and fun to play.,1
great puzzle game to pass the time. very relaxing sound track and fantastic learning curve,1
do download.... logical game with puzzly levels. i felt confused at beginning but it is the easiest game i ever played as i went forward winning the levels,1
this is amazing . its a game that train our mind with fun not like other brain training games that only ask questions that are some time too annoying. it very fun and fast game in which you dont have to get into,1
excellent little puzzle game. cute simple graphics  with puzzles that appear simple but can be very challenging!,1
really good experience playing the game  feature to add levels and make one are good. and levels later really challenges you.,1
intricate and lovely sets  feel empathy when characters gets zapped  he has personality! like the puzzle  problem solving part  dexterity challenging for older new to gaming person. wonderful job dev's,1
the best game i've come across. lots of additional levels can be downloaded and you can create and publish your own levels.,1
this game is mind-relaxing  with mellow music and sounds. the graphics are picturesque  minimal ads and puzzles are well constructed with cute characters.,1
i actually don't like the zapper. the should be no size limitation in creating a level. i also don't like the red bot that you have push or help you out in level 19 and the red bot with a zapper head to get away with.,0
this is one of the few mobile games that are genuinely fun without trying to milk your wallet dry. it's fun and relaxing and has just the right level of difficulty. i love it!,1
this app was very exciting ang also you can release your stress. and i also recommend this game to children  because this app can make your children's learn a lot . thats why i rate this app 5 stars,1
it's a good game  some of the levels i got stuck on but i beat those levels. only one level i had to go on youtube for  and that was level 13.,1
i love this game! seriously  whenever i plays this game  my mind gets relaxed. its too much fun to play the game. and the best moment is when that robot falls from the building or whatever that is. i seriously like this game. the only best offline game available in the google play..,1
this is a very cute puzzle.. i'm so sad that it's only have 50 levels and if you want to play more you can visit their facebook to click the link where you can download some of levels.,1
it's an amazing experience playing this  the graphics  the details  the structuring and the puzzles everything is on perfect set with bg music ofcourse,1
the graphics all are good. but this game is more of a reflex training than an actual brain twisting puzzles game. gets boring after sometime.,0
the robot keeps falling because of the smallest pushes from the movable parts of the puzzles. gets kinda annoying when you're so close to finish and the little idiot can't even stand by itself.,0
amazing gmeplay   even runs smoothly in small phones   i love the graphics very much amd the music increases the concentration . so good to play when there is no network available,1
this game is awesome! even though it is difficult  it is still fun and mind helpingly great to play. something good that this game needs  is no wifi. i absolutely love that. please make more amazing games like this. please.,1
superb!! this gmae is quiet difficult. but some levels are easy. nice game  nice graphics and nice controls.,1
what can i say about this game? it's so perfect! i can feel all the love and dedication of the developer. can't find a single defect on it  it's completely perfect! congratulations is the minimum you deserve for this amazing piece of art! thanks a lot!!,1
the new ui could have been better. the bottom section (story  master cards  build and you )could have been shorter in height,0
ahh! making something difficult for majority doesn't mean a good game. very poor controls. good thing you can create your own puzzles freely.,0
get. this. game. already! it is simply the best puzzle game. mind blowing graphics  amazing controls. its great.,1
it's very interesting and a challenging gaming..... if they provide small instructions will be usefull....... but from my point of view its a wonderful game eargly waiting for part2,1
this game is very nice. it is really a tricky one. i think only the perfect and intelligent people can win each level in this game. i like this game. mekorama... its an awesome name! well everyone can download this. but only the genius can win!!! i this game!,1
fantastic puzzle game that is hard enough to keep you thinking but not so impossible that you want to throw your phone out the window. add nice music and a cute robot and you've got a very well made game.,1
i absolutely love this game  and so does my 5 yr old daughter. it can be very challenging at times  frustrating at others  but always fun to play. if you haven't tried it...you need to. it is a great way to pass the time.,1
this is good game. there are many different levels . starting levels are not hard but levels is up and levels is also hard.,1
it's a well made game with simple to difficult levels. from visuals to simple yet effective sound design works quite good. loved it.,1
super fun game  i can't put it down. it males you think and its really creative. i loke how you can make your own levels and share them with friends. definitely a great game and app.,1
excelsior... its different  unique  quite perfect indeed... the graphics are unexpectedly good  and the game itself is made excellent!! love it!!,1
the idea and the whole structure is very cute and simple. sometimes you just can't get the controls properly,0
it's good   but i see potential for this game cuz i think that it needs more materials more features like actual free camera movement like you could go like in there pov and like go into buildings and like pause while in mid play and much more but overall good game!,1
awesome game! i really liked the concept and the fact that this is a really good brain teaser. althoigh the controls might be a bit shaky sometimes its a must have game,1
man!!! it just makes me happy whenever i play it. best concept best visuals best graphics giving it for free is kinda donation you did for the whole world. cause if this game is not paid then i don't know which game should be paid.,1
loved the whole game but had to delete it because of one issue  i can't even see through the little lanes or hallways whatever you call it to analyse how i'd get out same with the levels with water i can't see down there so how do i know where to go?? it's like playing blindly..... please fix those  i love it and i'd love to download again.....,0
so l saw this game in another game made by the same person martin magni called fancade this guy is a genius every single bit of his games are simply amazing the soundtrack the controls the game itself it's just so well made and the idea of making these well made games free then maybe if you could and want you can pay some money to get small perks that won't affect the game,1
beautiful game! the graphics are fun and fluid. challenging  but not impossible ,1
your game is great and doesn't consume alot of storage space unlike other games.i am really confused of how you made the game so small and yet the graphics are so good.. you need to make more games like this.. its so awesome,1
i love it! this is what all games should be like. it works off-line too. it is soothing and you can make your own levels! if you like slow peaceful puzzle games then get it!,1
incrdible i dont know what to mention this game has a lot. light weight app  graphics  new concept  ui is awesome  techniques are unique.,1
some of the levels are impossible  because my device is not touchscreen so i cannot touch in two places at once  could you please make controlls where you can click and hold to change view instead of useing two fingers  because i cannot click in two places at once.,0
the best   the cutest and the most challenging puzzle game that i played. thanks for creating this game i am so immobilized by its cute theme   sounds and graphics   it is really addictive game that challenge may creativity .,1
i love this game  the background music isnt annoying  graphics are so clear  challenging game but the control is a little bit slow and hard sometimes,0
i love the visuals  everything in this game was just awesome. tho  i hope there would be a lot of levels to explore and solve. thanks.,1
absolutely love this game. enjoyed it so much i played it twice. the little robot is cute and some levels can be tricky and make you think. highly recommended.,1
i miss strategy games like this  fantastic graphics  hard but achievable levels  absolutely awesome game. how can i submit one of my designs?,1
the graphics is excellent. concept is good. bad that even a single hint is not available for free!,1
this game is amazing. after a long time i found a game which is worth playing. amazing work you did guys making this game. the developer is really generous and kind. levels are not that hard. plus  i really enjoyed playing it.,1
please give more levels. all levels are easy. there should be more hard levels. nice gameplay. i liked it very much.,1
absolutely stunning and challenging game  i love everything about it  the graphics  music and the smoothness is spot on  great job dev !,1
almost fun. the reliance on weird motions makes it unruly to play on a phone touch screen. too much tricky maneuvering not enough puzzle.,0
i dont like rating apps and writing reviews. but this game is so good i just had to say something. for a free game  it provides longevity by allowing other people to make and share their own puzzles. i love this feature. great game  mr. magni! kudos!,1
awesome game  simply awsome game in such little mbs. also you can make your own levels thats simply amazing. awesome graphics  smooth gameplay.,1
really goooood game could get a rating 9.9 out of 10 . and also request for a second part of it as there were very less levels. worth downloading .,1
the game's good but the further i progressed into the game  the inability to change the perspective so you're looking only at a single side of the cube bothers me more and more,0
brilliant game for a toddler! relaxing music and sounds  yet fun and logic thinking promoting game. cute and funny robot. this is a game i would happily have payed for for not having any in-app-purchase offers. the author has really thought through the levels he created. thank you!,1
loved it at the download size it comes. but overall graphics & the game presentation is very well managed . kudos to your team,1
might look childish for once but tends to get challenging  engaging  addictive while maintaining its simplicity card! must try..,1
it's a nice and simple game . you can even create your own levels and play them once you've finished the first in-game levels. i liked it very much.,1
such a fun game  has beautiful graphics and nice sounds. love the levels as they get more difficult the farther you get.,1
its a really great game!! it gets my brain to work and there are no ads!! as you progress it gets more challenging and more fun.,1
wow no ads. politely asks for a donation but you don't have too. hope some people do give donations as it is well deserved. great little puzzle game. challenging but fun also. and you can even create your own puzzles. 5 stars all day every day with games like this.,1
really loved this game. simple  but still challenging ,1
very good graphics and good sensibility. i really appreciate. if you can customize restart button  it will be great looking game.,0
awsome game. just 2 suggestions. can you add a bot where you can make a path that he follows. and can you make a settings menu for bots  mtors and zappers? it would spark so many more level ideas.,1
friends play it  one of the best challenging game in play store.sound concepts  levels of puzzles and everything are magnificent.5stars no doubt its worth,1
amazing and fun game.... well graphics... little more challenging and it can improve our thinking capacity. there are 50 levels and thousands of fan made levels. so interesting levels. super game. thanks to mr. martin mangi sir to give this amazing game to us.,1
very nice game with pleasing sound and simple mechanics and great graphics. also very tricky......and playable. don't have any in app purchase   best thing.,1
defiently one of the best puzzle games i've played. love the design and the physics are pretty good. so i give it around 4 stars looks great!,1
too much ads.. ads actively interupts gameplay  pauses game to show ads. ads in between levels are fine. but pausing an active level just to show ads is not acceptable.,0
hey martin  it's a great game for every age group. you can think  make strategy  enjoy and make your own stages. i made some children to play this game who were addicted to shooting/firings/fighting/racing games. it's better than them and doesn't spoil their mental health.,1
i love this app. it is really very amazing as it makes you feel fun and also exercise your brain. it is the only game which i love the most. good graphics  good control  good features and good game. simple game which anyone can play also this game is very addictive.,1
5 stars as its deserve best mind game actually it's innovative specially for architect and architect student in this game we don't only have to solve game but we can also make our own level so it's very very helpful; i appreciate the work and the efforts made by developer to make this game,1
it has many levels but when you get carried away  it's easy to finish the game early adds more interest if more levels are there,0
gets difficult. it's definitely challenging. frustrating at times but it's a good puzzler.,1
the best of the best puzzle game i have ever played. great graphics  great controls and that tiny robot is sooooo cute. it make my day. thanks martiny.,1
this is fantastic game. no such issues when i played this game. this is excellent idea made this type game.this game size is small but graphics is so sweet.it's true mekaroma is relaxing  mindbloing  puzzle solving only less than 5 mb. thanks for making this type of game.,1
this game is very interesting and hard if u dont know game mechnics.for example,1
outstanding game. the game is very good qith good graphics  nice puzzles  good apperance of game  etc. we can also creat our own levels and play in it. and that also make it owsome thankyou guys who made this but you should make another mokorama 2 game and really we all are waiting for it to come thankyou again..........,1
omg! amazing offline with lowest size... you can create your own levels and share it to your friends... you can play custom levels with a screenshot with it's qr code... it's funny and dificult also. try this app you will really like this one. this is an over rated app.,1
took a little while to get the focus on how the game was played. the best thing is there are little twists and variations in each game. still learning.,1
this game is just incredible.....so relaxing yet challenging ...a nice workout for brain ... i really liked it.... it's totally worth ... anyone who likes puzzles should try this game.,1
great game  very peaceful but you can't always see what you're doing which can sometimes get a bit annoying. i'm having fun but also a little trouble on a couple of them. all together it's a pretty good game,0
it's a amazing game good graphics hard levels i'm giving it a 4 star rating because the hints are almost always hard to understand if you could fix it i might give it a 5 star rating,1
great puzzles. realy stretches my brain. controls are a little difficult but that may just be my phone. love the little robot dude.,1
i really loved this game. i have completed all the levels. am waiting for part 2. if mekorama 2 is there  i will download definitely. i reffered to my friends about this game.. they also started playing... its a simple and decent game.,1
great game. great programming. some are really challenging like levels 19 & 22. characters elicit a smile watching the animations. i love the fact that donations are a simple ask. they deserve the donation for the superior work.,1
the puzzles are not rocket science  but the game offers some play through value and the graphics are very well put together.,1
i've been looking for good mobile games on the internet for quite sometime i saw this game on the suggestions everytime but i never bothered downloading it because i thought it would be boring then i downloaded it today and mannn am i loving this game! i really wish i could have payed some bucks for this game. i love it!!!,1
loved it  great piece of work  hadlots of fun playing it  spent many hours going through the puzzles and when i finally solved it  the feeling is awsome. must try,1
this sentence is coming from malay. kecil kecil cili api. it means it's a very good game although it was in a small download size. the problem is a roofed building with a blocker bot. i can't move much.,0
this game is a challenging puzzle try this one its massively cool and interesting game also i was happy that i can create levels without payments. thanks for creating this game.,1
fantastic game which pushes you to think.. somewhere you need to observe how things work and then strategise! excellent puzzles!,1
great puzzle game. really well designed. a good place to relax while still challenging your brain a bit.,1
the game was really good before the stars came in and the levels started being easy as heck  even a two year old kid could solve this  i prefered the game when it was harder  now it's just stright up trash,0
absoulutely loved this game. very addictive. i completed all the levels. the levels are really challenging. mind blowing game .,1
this game is a great time killer. the character is cute and the graphics are awesome. some puzzles are hard but not impossible.,1
i like this game a lot. it has a charming robot and we have to help him by completing each puzzle or level. u all should try fancade. it is also a good game. plzz... download this game and enjoy,1
nice game. i have problems though. my map cannot have a permanent solution. and i want a tutorial because i don't fully understand the game yet. i hope my problem gets fixed soon.,0
someone recommended this game for me   and i have been olaying it since then. it's a really good game that makes you think if your next step   the character is so cute and it's ime killing. love it!!.,1
the game is extremely awesome.some updates are needed for making this the best game i have ever played you guys should allow us to sign in for play games and should allow us to make our self made levels publicize. the conclusion is ; this game is aweso e but updates will make it the best.,1
this game is amazing! can i kill the red? just kidding. work more in rotations  adjust it. i find it hard because of the rotation. ,0
beautiful game. great art style. love the music. overall  this artistic indie game is amazing to play and even more fun to finish.,1
to be honest this game is really bland  the physics are wonky and the levels are super easy  it's practically pay to win since you can't use hints since the game just expects you to know everything about the mechanics of the game  really sloppy  i don't reccomend.,0
this game is great and used brain very good. every level i feel like i have a new brain challenge. not like most of the games repeat itself.,1
this is a must have app for all the puzzle and maze lovers  its very essential and my go to app to whenever i want to intellectually stimulate my brain. its an absolute time killer  not forgeting its soothing music and funny robots. well done martin.,1
i really enjoy the puzzles so far  they are engaging an even though they are fairly simple at the start (i'm by level 15) they're very entertaining.,1
i really love the game and it is very addicting. the flaw i see is that it is not only intelligence you need  but also motor and sensor abilities. this flaw is my personal view and should not be taken very serious,1
relaxing puzzle game! i love playing this game. the puzzles are challenging  but very fun. would definitely recommend downloading!,1
it's coolest game i have ever played man!!!! grophics r cool controls are sooo smooth and awesome levels . this game is soothing and so it's background music. this game make me think in a different way . devloper shoulf be praised.,1
nice game  ads not too overdone. level 39 master makers (red balls by el797)  i finally sunk all three balls after who knows how many tries  and the dang red bot walked on top of them then got stuck in that spot. couldn't climb out to the star. frustrating!,0
the robots are cute. the gameplay is smooth and very less ads. challenging  interesting and entertaining game. totally worth 5 stars.,1
i first played this gane 2 years ago and completed it... today i want to play it again.. i first start this first 2 levels were same just that stars collecting was new and it make game more interesting... and there are so many new levels i loved it...,1
i think this puzzle app is great   just a little bit more update   add more puzzle game into it and some qay i can be able to send my puzzle i created to a friend and let them solve them   i think thats a good idea right?,1
nice game but some levels are tough to solve can you give hint without any cost. afterall great game  we can make our own cards.,1
very entertaining! a little difficult on certain levels to tap where you need to  so i am stuck on a couple.,1
the concept is really good. the graphics is incredible. but most importantly it gets tougher and tougher and keeps you glued.,1
i'm knocking off a star due to constant harassment about paying the deveoper.other than that it's fun challenging  plenty of levels  and no ads is a plus.,1
this game is challenging  inquisitive  most of all ... fun!! i love the free-build feature. i've spent hours building different stages. i love this game.,1
super duper app i love it never bored play this game because there are many level we can get out there like search at google for qr code  sometime i feel stressed because that level to hard but it's not your fault  it's my brain that can't thinking to much anyway  love this app,1
when you're stressed af! it'll help you relax ! it's minimal design ! no ads! and cute graphics .great job. you feel satisfied when you complete each card. p.s please give some cute name to that robot like add a storyline or something,1
the best puzzle game i have ever played. literally i've fallen in love with this game. the music is amazing as well as relaxing  so is the sound. it deserves more than 5,1
wow! i usually am addicted to different strategic and online pvp battles but this game takes my experience to the whole new level. just few word from my side = absolutely amazing game = brilliant work from the developers. please keep on developing such games.,1
beautiful design  controls are smooth and the game itself is clever and offers you a nice play time. this a diorama puzzle game  a cute mix between captain toad and monument valley. i highly recommend mekorama  congratulations for this fine piece of work!,1
excellent ! this game is really fun . the puzzles are mind boggling but the graphics and picture quality is really cool . thanks for making such a game.,1
nice little game to challenge the grey matter. gets progressively hard. minimal ads. easy control. aesthetically pleasant. recommend it!,1
i personally like the game but please remove bug where the shadows of moving object stays just use draggables and stick it to ground the shadow is stilk there also please make the world bigger maybe you can build your thing without running out of space and also dont forget new wheels where u can move it with button also more smarter a.i pls cuz the ai is kind of an idiot here soo please fix ok ill love it!,0
awesome game! graphics are great  soundtrack isn't annoying  you can even create your own level!,1

mekorama is a wonderful lil' puzzle solving game with beautiful enriched graphics and a cute cast of robot characters. it's fun for all ages! i highly recommend this game. especially if you're a fan of the puzzle genre.,1
absolutely phrnomenal gaming experience. martin magni knows how to grip the gamer to the game. you get to do some light-heavy brain exercise and this game is has incredible graphics and interfaces. has been great to play and seeing the bot go in level 50 i felt really sad. thanks martin magni.,1
very interesting game..i already like {c}..i think he is quite a cute little robot and the music tone of the game is very soothing.i think everyone can play the game..they just need to be in the right mindset. thank you...although plz if u would just add more characters or more colour skins to the robot...thank u!!!,1
it's an unique 3d maze game where you can interact with the environment. also wonderful textures! 5 for the idea and gameplay. thank you developer!,1
i think it's a great game and i love the building aspect of the game one cing do i'll be better if it had a straight angle of view on top and from the side and illumination over all is great .,1
enjoyed every single level   it is really a 3d puzzle game different from the regular one found everywhere. amazing work hoping to see more similar themed games from you   amazing !,1
it is fantastic... really good theme and few levels require real intelligence... moreover it also helps you making your own leaves... really good game.....,1
lovely app to spend some time with in quarantine! i grew quite fond of the little fellows. heck  i even came to like the electro executioners. well done and very entertaining.,1
elders can play with little ones easily and yet its not too boring neither easy. each stage is a good challenge.,1
fun logical puzzles  great graphics  controls are very easy . fun for all to play. thanks!,1
interesting and engaging. most levels are easily completed once you get the hang of it.,1
great and wonderful. full of colors  music and interaction. great puzzles and easy for pasing some time.,1
it is good and all but can you please add maore maps because there are just 50 they are challenging but please add more but thanks for this game you could even build your own map..,0
first few levels were good  but later on we stuck at a point and there is no option of getting hints as well. we need to pay for the hints.... after paying you feel you are not satisfied with it....,0
the game play needs improvement. when you try to move the wheel the surrounding starts rotating. and the game is buggy. kindly fix this.,0
i love this game! there is an adventure in every new level and exciting. but the problem is the bot use to stuck in lvl 41. pls fix this. the bot can't enter the hole.,0
very intresting and fun to play also it helps us to build different types of level. not only these it helps to generate idea.,1
really good game ! i love it . the gameplay is also very nice . it is really a brain tester . i love making my own levels rather than playing the levels of this game . but it's still awsome !!! love it so much . thanks for making it,1
absolutely amazing!!! brilliant concept  superb graphics  addictive gameplay. best game for analytical reasoning and problem solving.,1
played this with my aunt when she was still alive. reminds me of the times when my aunt asks me for help whenever she gets stucked on a level. love this game because of that  and also because it's just a really darn good game overall.,1
i love this game  but getting qr codes in a bit tedious. i think it might be better if you could upload levels through the app  like fancade. please consider maybe? i would like to upload my own levels.,0
the sounds are relaxing and the game itself is like a fun brain training puzzle. great for passing time!!,1
everything is good untill........ dont worry i'm not gonna write some imperfection because this is perfectly perfect but the thing is that it become easy for me...i had completed all the levels in just 5 days so if u will pls add some more level in it then this app will become worth again for me,0
breathtaking. most amazing puzzle game i haver ever played in my life. most amazing levels this game is the integrity of some of the best developers in the world. very well done guys.,1
it is a nice game worth giving a try. graphics and controls are awesome wiith trickier levels and mind consuming play strategy.,1
excellent game. no ad s. bug free. clean application super smooth game play is nice with excellent graphics. i am happy. i like the game as l progress.,1
loved it!! absolutely delightful. clean ui  no ads  pay as you want  beautiful music. great work all in all. happy playing ,1
aggressive ads. it put ads even before the game saved the progress  with different device setting  it will reset the game after the ads  that needs you to redo the supposedly solved puzzle.,0
really good game with really creative puzzles that always keeps you engaged and doesnot forces itself to be a difficult puzzle game but rather a clever puzzle game.,1
brilliant game! loving the absence of ads!! finally a game with great graphics that is genuinely puzzling & enjoyable. developers - i salute you!,1
this is a amazing puzzle game(cute bots  nice graphics  soothing background music) that you not only play but you can also make your own mekorama levels & you can also post your levels in mekorama forum website... (it makes me feel happy ,1
robot is adorable. very interesting and challenging logic game. no glitches. very enjoyable and quite addictive. love it.,1
the game's pretty neat but with the touch controls can be a bit hard to pin point where you want your character to go.,0
it is a great game with different level and the best thing is that we can make our own levels and it is too cheap also it is the best puzzle game i have ever played. i loved it,1
it is a very good game under 20 mb   high quality graphic good control systems but some glitches are there 1. in few cases robo was dont go where i locate . 2. in coustom i dont make 2 yellow robo(it is not a bug),0
excellent for the whole family. no ads  no annoying music or interruptions  no hidden purchases for my kids to avoid. a polite option to support the developer. all kid-friendly aps should be like this!!,1
it is excellent in every way. controls are not frustrating and for a graphics like that it should not be free,0
it's a totally mind blowing game . so good graphics and controls and also very challenging levels. i love this game very much.,1
hello dear martin first i have to thank you for a such a wonderful game... and i really likes the way u did... no annoying ads.. and the payment method its big change from the others... i paid what i can now... i hope in the future i will pay little bit more.. honestly ur work deserves that... we looking more games and apps like this.. huge thumbs up for u....,1
i played this game when it first came out and the community then  and since has always been wonderful. it's a quick little solo play puzzle game with innovative features  and when you get into the community levels it'll only get better.,1
we can't afford the game  but i promise if we had the money i would definitely buy it for my 5 yo severe autistic grandson.. this is one of his favorite games... not sure if he's playing correctly but he can build his little honey off...,1
there is a problem in seeing the whole dimension because of that i have to play some level by just plain assumption. like in level 9 temple of athena. you must add a full maneuverability of the whole scene in that level otherwise there will be a whole lot of assumption,0
it's a really simple and extremely polished puzzle game  and when you finish with the main ones  the community has you covered definitely recommended,1
game is truly challenging and mind boggling but level 41 is not working.. please fix it as soon as possible because i want to end this challenging game.,0
its a very good game. pritty clean. i spend most of my time making levels for my friends. my only problem is the small amount of levels.,1
the game is basically unplayable. it wouldn't register when i tapped the screen except for the pause button  and even then  that only worked a few times.,0
this is a truly enjoyable game. it is adventurous and causes one to use one's mind. this game seems to improve one's mental ability to solve problems and improve one's understanding and patience.,1
great little app packed with awesome levels this deserves a 11/10. the only issue i have is with the camera angle  at some points i can't see jack *  but it works. thanks for an awesome game,1
first of all adorable character  second it's fun entertaining unpredictable mentally challenging but not stressful and overall a good brain teaser. i recommend this game to anybody.,1
awesomeness  i am in search for such game. will surely purchase. currently in amidst of corona epidemic. let me start earning again. until then thanks. the in game sound is very soothing as well the game play. not typical puzzle game rather fluid.,1
most innovative and out of the mainstream game ili have ever played. a must for both puzzle solvers and creators. this is such a treat.,1
i like the little character. its movements are realistic enough to generate a surprising amount of empathy. some of the solutions are tough  and some surprising. i love that.,1
the best things in life are unexpected  this game is one of them  no ads  flawless gameplay and great levels.,1
this is the type of game that goes unnoticed when it shouldn't! it is so awesome - it's one of the best games i've ever played and downloaded on my device - that i've literally played for so long i don't even notice the time passing. definitely must download!,1
love these types of games. gotta use your brain to get thru the levels. nice job! no ads is the best part of it all. they are soooo irritating. thanks!,1
its a very intresting game made for genius... those who things he/she is a genius can try this game... but i'm sure that he/she can't complete 25 level.... so its my recommendation to try this game and those who going to try this game best of luck....,1
i can't say anything negative... really. i love how quirky and fun it is. i get flustered each time i try a new level. some of the puzzles remind me of the stuff from alundra or wild arms back in the day... whooooheeee what a ride!,1
a vefy immersive experience and best game for mental exercises. every level have different logic and a different experience.,1
this is an incredible puzzle game with lots of fun puzzles though a few rely on reflexes instead of puzzle solving and one is puzzle is just wrong the rest just pure fun to figure out,1
its fun. i absolutely love how cute the robot is. the puzzles are really good too.thy make you think. i can't not leave a review after getting to level 22,1
i haven't had such an engrossing game since lemmings. graphics and controls are simple but brilliant.,1
i like this game . it is so relaxing and one of the bests for time pass. it also helps you think. graphics are also so good. i play this game when im bored and it helps me refresh.,1
i absolutely love games that present a bit of a challenge  have great graphics  and logic in the gameplay... this game has it all!! *****,1
this game shows everyone how even a silly mission to reach a spot by a cute little robot can be so interesting. looking forward to more versions ,1
i just finished all the level in less than 12 hours without hint (maybe because the covid19 at my country and yeah you know the conditions) and i enjoy the game. no ads but you must donate first to use hint and sometimes the app ask you for a donation. it's just fine for me.,1
it's the best puzzle game ever. i love this game so much thanks martin for making this game. i have completed the game. it was so tricky .50 levels and waiting for next update.,1
it's an awesome game . i like spending time on playing it   but the only fear i have is that what will i do when all levels will be completed . i request the developers to create more versions of this game . thanks for reading !,1
i love this game. simple yet hard  challenging but relaxing. i love making my own levels and trying other peoples levels. if i had money  i would donate some. 10/10 totally recommend,1
great app  great graphics  awesome gameplay one can enjoy it without paying anything. no ads make it must try. i would like to have more games like this. i appreatiate. i support,1
at first i thought it was a simple puzzle game with wonky game physics. now i know why  since it will later be a part of another puzzle. brilliant.,1
i love this game very much  it helps you think smarter in a way... i also love that this game takes up less space and also works offline while providing such amazing animation and design,1
the game has a good ramp in difficulty. controls are simple. graphics are great. really enhoy this game,1
absolutely fantastic game.you can create your own levels or complete challenging levels. it is a good game for mind development.,1
a really fun and well designed game... no lags  no glitches  no crashes  etc...great for all age groups.,1
i have played lots of mystery solving games but this one is the best of all and the size of the game was also too low. i enjoy playing this game. best time passing game with increasing the iq level,1
mekorama is a calming game. i use it to help me with feelings of anxiety or depression. it's a unique little platformer/puzzle game and i think if you give it a try  you might enjoy it. have a nice day ,1
just had a great but sometimes frustrating time but mekorama is just the perfect low storage game with great graphics and neat gameplay.,1
very intresting game  its one of the best maze games i have ever played. it elevates u like while playing rusty lake games   just that its a lot more easier and nice. i hope the developer would soon add more interesting levels to the game soon,1
good game concept. pathetic character control. the character moves like a drunkard. you never know which path he would take to reach destination point.,1
this is the third time i'm installing this cute game. never bored with it. quite challenging and mind cracking. have always loved these kind of puzzles....keep it up martin! thanks!,1
awesome and real tricky game. its real tough to cross levels after completing 25th level. i suffered a lot and had lots of fun in this game amd even we can create levels i thats what i like more in this game.thank u martin for creatimg such a beautiful game,1
d ,1
great alternative to monument valley. fun puzzles and interesting solutions. controls sometimes elusive  but great game and cute robot!,1
very brilliant game in such at low space 3d graphic   puzzle   ect keep it better than now in future and add multiplayer in it so we can enjoy with our friends.....,1
i do enjoy the style and gameplay  but stopped playing after a while since it got frustrating and annoying after a while.,1
what a cute game with delightful animation and really makes you think to solve spatial puzzles! very well designed!!,1
i really like this game.this game is really addictive. difficult to cross some levels but i love a concept of this game. where i can design my own level and i can play levels created by people. this game never ends,1
pure pleasure. fun and logical game  free but no commercial. feels a bit retro. i have not see better and more honest game in years. i will go give donation to developer now. get a game and then be a nice person - pay.,1
it's a great game for thinkers and puzzle solvers and who will play just for fun so i fully support this game so if u want to install this game it's great u can installl! i m so proud that to tell i completed all the levels exept the 49th level it's really worst traffic note ,1
awesome sensibilities and aesthetics. magni really gets the sense of toying associated with puzzle games. love the level editor as well.,1
ok good good game but i have 2 big problem aout this game ,1
it's somuch fun and relaxing and those puzzles are so beautiful especially the ability to make your own map ... i think i wont uninstall it forever.,1
it's a nice mind blowing puzzle game and i like ut very much. makes us to think in a different way to solve each puzzle.,1
it's really cute i loved the puzzle they are easy and you can further levels without paying too which is rare to find across in games these days.,1
this is a very nice game  it has nice graphics  interesting puzzles and all that in 4.3 mb. honestly it's the best puzzle game i have ever played.,1
tricky but fun. love the look of the puzzles  robot is so cute plus the pay what you can or write a review for a free hint. thst is a great idea. recommend this to try.,1
there are a million games in play store. but this one is so special and unique. my friends often got bored of any games play. until this one came along. its a must try for all ages. you will go nuts in somelevel. totally worth it.,1
it's a creative game with a very cute little robot for which we have to clear the maze and with very interactive design . thinking and fun  ideal for children.,1
this game is f..n awesome.level 14 convinced me that its more than a game the strategy you use in level 14 would be enough to ensure your iq is above 100.it didnt take me more than 10min to get the strategy and feel proud to cross that stupid friend!!moreover this game is the best of best in only 5mb.just look at the game the graphics and animations.....and especially the puzzles are by far too awesome.this game would improve your iq if you play it.i apreciate the developers as well for d game,1
i am just confused. i already donated some cash to this app with this same google account. i uninstalled it ang changed my phone then re-installed it. now its asking me to donate again? hmmm sketchy. good game though. perfect for passing the time while making ur brain work.,0
overall an amazing app. very fun to play  stuff gets harder everytime and makes it fun and challenging to play. deffinetly would recommend.,1
i love the style and idea of this game  but the level design is just boring and atrocious. who though an uncontrollable guy who just functions to walk back and forwards to slow you down was a good idea?,0
i love puzzle games like this  and this game deserves 5/5 the controls are easy to understand and the colorful graphics makes this a great game,1
this game great. but they make no allowances for people who have not only paid for the game but even paid more than they were asking for. i guess they are only interested in collecting money no matter how they get it. no matter how many times they charge you. money grubbers,0
the best game which opens our brain and let us remember every proverb. like where there's a will there is a way!really awesome game. everybody try it who are not so intelligent also try it.it will increase ur iq.it teaches us to keep our brain calm and cool.i am proud that there is such intelligent person to create this game.please play the game.,1
good brain challenge. nice game. if you could make with a treasure hunt or some sort of adventure it would be better.,1
so far it's very fun but the way you get hints is annoying to a extent. other than this it's been challenging but fun.,1
i think there was a problem,0
"a refreshing game with a really cool ""card"" system where each level is stored on a card. you can make levels and then share the card with your friend. and you can collect cards from your friends.",1
not addictive  but perfect for playing for short time. i hate games which makes u feel so addictive and cannot do any other work. this game helps me relax inbetween work!,1
great little puzzle game  love the physic mechanics used. only just started the game today  hence not full 5 stars. will need to get further into the game.,1
this is my all time favourite game. i completed the game many times and i always have this with me. the music the robo the structure the levels the eye of robo everything every single thing is best.,1
it is challenging and more interesting to solve it..now i'm getting addicted to it.. just loved the game   such an amazing graphics ! ,1
this game is mindblowing amazing and fantastic. this game needs very intelligent mind that can clear the stages. this makes good understanding and it contains so many difficult riddeles. thanks for reading my opinion.,1
very interesting and mind twisting solving game that is great to exercise the brain to think for the way out. loving it and supporting all the games that are like this.,1
much interesting and brain killer game. many stages take up much brain to solve. many forced me to watch solution on youtube. but overall is nice. i am waiting for stages updates. i have cleared all,1
very fun and challenging game. gets you thinking but isn't impossible. seldom ads and fun  unique levels.,1
its a brilliant game with crazy details and puzzle if you have a amoled or oled display it looks so much sharp you can't believe this its only 5-6 mb   if i could i would pay for the game   download the game and if you can please donate something thank you.,1
good game and very much interesting. i have some suggestions 1.you can make more levels built in game 2.you can add more blocks on build section and on the game also 3.you can add new window called online in which players can download play and share the puzzles made by them thank you for reading and hope that will help.,0
i absolutely love this game  it's filling my game void from finishing tiny robots which i loved too. this is great  i keep looking to see how many i have left. i'm about half way thru. make more pleeeease!,1
it's a really fun game with a cute  little robot  and it even has a level editor. however  the level editor is kinda hard to use.,0
i seriously am in love with this game. great time killer too! i love the challenges that each level gives you. it starts super easy so even my little cousins can enjoy this.,1
good game in very less storage..and there are many kind of puzzles and you can create your own puzzle or level..and it is a offline game.,1
complete with lots of levels  smooth graphics  fitting music  and even a level maker  all under 5 mb! if i could donate i would!,1
it's extremely cool  relaxing and tricky game. you'll fall in love with the character. it's extremely cute  all your stress vanishes with it.,1
i am giving one star because of ad's they fall between the game and our focus on it gets over . good game but craches also i have 4 gb ram but it lacks in game playing. i am a youtuber i wants to play the game which don't lage and crash between playing it . graphics is good but as a youtuber i wants to play game without ad break .,0
totally awesome keeps you thinking. it looks very easy but i think it's more eye coordination because at anytime you can fall it really is worth a donation keep up the good work and yes this grandmother gives you the ultimate two thumbs up,1
i think it's an amazing game! from the music and the sounds it records after u move the character is genius! very therapeutic btw.,1
amazing bro martin . u have given great feel to us. if it can be changed to in to action game . it will break all records. graphics and themes are out of the box. alot of love.,1
beautifully crafted visuals and creative use of screen space. simple but joyful adventure puzzle game.,1
its fantastic  just incredible.. i will recommend it to you.. instead of that rubbish 2-3 gb games.. its just 5 mb.. how the hell on this earth that is possible but martin did it.. hats off to you bro... incredible programming.. incredible script.. i feel i was in some other planet... rescuing my bot...,1
simple and great. good brain teaser. i completed 10 levels still i didn't use the hint option. good time killer and boost up your thinking,1
this game is so much fun and very addicting  it is like a puzzle for your brain and i love how the levels are in different areas of the world. 5 stars!!!,1
cool graphics  the puzzles are to hard for this dumb-dumb  but in a good way. control is smooth. mike,1
oh  what a game! how could you fit this huge game only in 2.5mb??!! unbelievable! everyone should play this awesome game. cause  it has no limit! just build your own levels and challenge your friends!,1
it's been fun playing out tricky puzzles. really addictive and was just hoping for few more levels but overall was awesome to play.,1
amazing.. my favorite puzzle game of 2020. i applaud your creativity  how you generate the music from the players movement is very impressive. great game.,1
the whole game is just awesome. at the beginning it looks very easy  but they get harder and harder. one of the best games i played. ever,1
it's great!! nice graphics  cool interface. easily one of the best 3d puzzle games i've played.,1
fun little game with a variety of puzzles to get your mind working. the art style is nice and the music is relaxing.,1
"this is such an amazing game to play ! i loved it the day i downloaded it   i didn't think it was a good game at first but when i saw the number of levels and the ""create your own levels""   i was glad i took a look at this game . 5 stars   wish i could do more but google play isn't letting me . i recommend everyone to try this game.",1
"wow! this is the ultimate brain booster puzzle!!! yet not boring and has good graphics. helps you thiiink and improve your mental ability. thanks to martin magni for ""mekorama"".",1
fantastic game  well thought out and looks amazing. well worth a look and one i'll happily play for hours the level editor is such a good addition.... not used it yet as i've only just discovered it. 5/5 for mekorama,1
this is really a master piece a good graphics 3d puzzle game where we can make our own level also i recommend everyone to play this game when they feel to do some brain exercise 5 star for this .,1
very interesting puzzles. graphics is good. all the levels are different in their own ways.,1
puzzles are mostly trivial... the challenge is the ui and visibility. you will get nautous after a while rotating the 3d models over and over trying to make out some path. sound is also horrible  apparently by design to make you feel immersed with zappy robot.,0
it's a very good game.... i love it a lot. when i played it first time i thought that this is boaring... after completing 6th level i found it more interesting... i was so curious to reach the end.. and i won the game,1
needs lot of patience and control to this game . simple  charming but brain-challenging game. completed all the levels.,1
nice puzzles in the games.i liked the game but i need some improvement in the game. that is when we make our levels there is limited world size. please make the world size very big. please!!!!. althrough nice game and puzzles.,1
excellent game... the art the level design  the character animations- it's brilliant.a very satisfying game to play.,1
this puzzle game is amazing! sometimes i get frustrated with some of the levels  but that is the main purpose of the game. rest of the stuff is great ! i really recommend this game,1
cute graphics. simple but challenging gameplay. not for those who don't have much patients.,1
very challenging but rewarding to finish that one pesky level. no ads. pay what you'd like.,1
i've wanted an app that i could make fun game levels with but not have to do too much programming. this app lets you do that with ease.,1
- ayush wadile ,0
fun puzzling game amd kinda funny too. i wish the camera to look aorund the puzzle was not locked in 90 degree intervals but free orbit. other than that its a great game,1
ok simple best graphic game. but there is no more cards. and also i needed some more robo character. thank you for this wonderful game. i like it. i have shared to my friends this game.,1
game is ok. puzzles are quite easy and doable. the real challenge is to fight the unprecise cumbersome tap/drag system.,0
the developer keeps begging you for money. there is also a rare bug where if 2 npcs get to a corner at the same time from 2 sides they keep headbanging each other and get stuck not being able to progress their ways which forces you to restart the level,0
very very good work. love the concept and love the game overall. graphics and movements are great.,1
awesome! i would definitely pay you for the game  but i can't right now. i don't know if it is my emulator or what  but the game music is so distorted it even sounds eerie. do you have an idea about what could have happened?,1
i love this cute mekorama. the way this robot walk is so funny. awesome game and superb graphics!!! plus it doesn't ask you to pay for anything. you can pay as much as you want. please make more games like this,1
it's very good but some confusen have in this game.robot is very funny control is good but not fully move what i want and one more thing is good that we can zoom.i do not see this game before. very good game but not for children please download it. good mind free game.,1
i love this game but can you make it so we can see everything because sometimes it super annoying when i have to go somewhere i cant even see but other than that amazing game with no adds,0
absolutely loved it!!!! great game  new concepts are introduced slowly so you get used to it. can play without internet. made my nights. thank you! love love love!,1
pretty fun  but annoying and tedious at times. also the message asking for donations every time you do something gets very annoying.,0
hints should be given for some levels instead of pay and take method. otherwise it becomes too tough for clearing some levels like lv 19 robo valley . coming to game it is the best game i have ever seen from my childhood under 10 mb,0
addicting with great graphics. wish the image could be rotated to any position rather than predetermined spots.,0
an undo and redo button would be nice and it would be nice to keep the field straight rather than being in isometric.,0
a great game but the 'make your own level' feature could do with some work. other than that  the game's splendid.,1
this app is awesome 1. it has a very low size and can run on any device 2. graphics are good as this game is low size 3. levels are challenging and good overall 5 star experience,1
it is good puzzle game and its graphics is nice. it is a very tricky game and we wnt to burn our heads in the harder level to solve the puzzle,1
great design with some cool levels. though some are borderline unplayable and the controls are finicky,0
it's a great game. pretty hard to complete (i'm stuck on 2 levels) i love they way it quantizes your moves into a tune.,1
very nice game.the little robot is so adorable. it walks like a toddler. the game starts with easy levels but gradually it gets hard which will make you think,1
good game  too many ads. when they say occasional ad they mean after each level. yes they are short ads but very repetative,0
i dig this game! relaxing 3-d puzzles with a tiny robot. no issues so far so thanks for a simple yet entertaining game.,1
engaging puzzles that make you expand your problem solving skills. giving 5 stars no bugs so far and every level is better than the last.,1
i could have given more than 5 stars as the game has even more fun as compared to its size.i really appreciate the developer to make this game which also includes a bit of brain exercise. moreover this game is offline and add free!!,1
very challenging. but everyone must try this one. needs lot of brain work . anyway i love it . well done developers . i like the movements of that little buddy .,1
meh! didn't find it too interesting. i mean there's only one spot the robot can ever move to  so you just keep clicking on different locations and eventually you click on the right one and he goes there.,0
amazing little puzzle game with the cutest tiny robot you've ever seen..... but why can my granddaughter clear levels in seconds when it takes me hours??!!! lol!!,1
xoxo i love this game the little robot is so cute .at first it was easy but now it getting a bit challenging in every level but anyways it's a really fun game to play.good job to the developers. and to you who is reading this review download this game it's worth it,1
truly good game difficulty increase at every level new way and new concepts to solve puzzles truly loved this game i hope developer will create part 2 for this with better puzzles and new concept great effort by martin magni hope so in future we will see a better popular game by you,1
nice game. makes us think. logical and interactive. simplistic music and very good graphics.,1
this was a very enjoyable experience. it really engages your brain. i found my self at 3am in te morning trying to find a solution to a puzzle. to the developers;well done,1
the best detailed mobile game that's very fun and has interesting puzzles all of which r simple yet if u do not look at it properly u will be stuck. in all its a very good game that deserves more than a 5 star review,1
this is a tricky game where you have to play 50 level by level a smart person can solve these puzzle. puzzle is not so hard but this game can change your mind set . i think you have to try this game,1
totally new concept  mesmerising graphics and negligible size make it a must- play. requires decent iq.,1
wonder full puzzle game. all the levels in the game are awesome. best part is players can build their own puzzle.,1
"amazing little puzzle game. it's awesome what someone can create with ""simple"". great game! i love it!",1
mekorama is addictive game for me. but it's to hard when there is no hints  please improve this game.. maybe free hints or every pass level we will get hints.. just my opinion.. thank you..,1
it's a really good puzzle and everything is completely free. you can only pay if you want to support the developer. respect,1
even the game is simple. the cute graphic and puzzle are interesting to play and spend the leisure time.,1
i think that every one should play this game it's a mind catching game we have to search way for reaching end point we can make our own level and we can play it even though if our level is ok by the game maker every one can play it .so at last i want to say that every one should play makoramaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,1
love this game! i had this game in the past .i have a galaxy note 10 and for what ever reason the game is not playing on a full screen. if anyone can help with this issue  i would greatly appreciate it. thanks for your time!,1
i'll ive been searching for this game in years  i kept typing nekorama thinking it was the name of the game but turns out one letter could make a large difference  it's because of my misspelling that i couldn't find this game.,1
i like it cuz it has some really challenging levels and its fun and the graphics are really nice too .. the music choice is soothing as well,1
best puzzle game ever with low download size  excellent graphics  good controls .... i love everything about this game ... i appreciate you martin magni for your work and keep it going ...,1
this game is fiendishly clever. the puzzles are a frustrating challenge that are hard to put down. the app is well thought out and executed.,1
thanx to developer. being of only 5 mb  it is very good game and editors choice also .best thing of this game is that  we can create levels. and i love the bacground music too.,1
very good game. it increases our level to think and solve very hard and interesting levels. may the most people should play this game.,1
love the game deserves 5 stars. the controls arent smooth but i think it is like that so that the game is challenging...,1
controls are wonky. often doesn't do what i want it to. overall just a frustrating experience.,0
nice puzzles and graphics is also amazing. like the concept where one can create their own puzzle. ,1
i absolutely loved this game and even if you have finished the story mode game then you can go to master and play the other people's map and the best thing is i can build my own map but i had a doubt after i make the map will other people be able to see and play my map  can the creator of this game answer my doubt?,1
its a cute game with good challenges. i have so far found them not too tough which suits my appetite and the stages i finished didnt take a lot of time so the game seems to be an excellent time pass,1
brilliant creation by a solo developer. @martin magni  you really inspired me to think out of the box. spent money for the first time on any app. giving 5 stars  keep up the good work!!! consider it as a little reward from my side to worth your efforts and admiration on your talent of creation.,1
nice game. best in free time. if you think levels are hard...no problem you can create your own level. 10 000 thanks to martin mangi and team,1
i loved the game too much. martin magni has made the best logical game. the levels are difficult and make much fun. and yes  the character is too cute. thanks martin magni..,1
i really like the game! its really cool and challenging!! but now i created my own game and i want to send this to martin magni! so that he/she can play my game the he will add it to the main levels.... so that mekorama will grow further!,1
adorable game  nice cute character. ever expanding and logical game. easiest way to get new levels. would like to 3000 stars but here only 5 are available.,1
it's refreshing to see a free game of this quality completely 100 percent ad free!! because there wasn't the annoyance of ads i donated $4 to the creator! thank you! great game!,1
great game for relaxing just download and try it you won't regret it. i love it and the fact that you can make your own levels and play other people's levels just adds so much more to it. one of the best games for your phone.,1
pretty good game  it's just that later levels are more of rinse and repeat till it works instead of actual puzzles.,0
it was a good thought provoking game that can make a person think in many ways it is one of the great game i downloaded every games don't impress me so fast it was a great experience with mekaroma thank you so much for a good gaming experience,1
it is a very interesting game in low mb for the person who really like to solve problems and puzzles. this game has a lot of fun  every level has an interesting problem and twists. the best feature of this game is that we can also make levels in this game. i have seen a lot of games but it is most interesting. loved tooo much . i want to rate it more than 5 stars but i can't so,1
amazing and addictive. interesting puzzles will capture young and old alike. i don't have many games on my device but this is staying!,1
i really like this game  it's simple and has cool graphics! it would be cool if the camera rotation was more flexible tho!,1
this is a out the box puzzle game  hay what can i say life is a little puzzling sometime this game can be very helpful to help you use the mind (whats in your thinking skills set) this is the game to get if you enjoy puzzles & rpg's,1
this game is so cute addictive and funnn!!! yey  i really like this game. every levels are exciting and thrilling and plus the mini robot is cute! thanks for creating this fantastic game! i highly recommend it to everyone;),1
lovely game but a shame purchases to go ad free can't be added to the family library. i'd rather pay a bit more for one hit for the whole household than have to pay per person.,0
this is a beautiful relaxing game. it's puzzling and challenging and at the same time incredibly calming and easy going. love the music  love the game.,0
superb game. i like this game very much. please send new updates to our brilliant players. i already finished master levels upto 35 levels. i didn't get any new updates from now. please send new updates.,1
awesome game! the robots are so cute! and the puzzles are hard enough to be challenging but not too hard to get past,1
this was a fun game  a lot like monument valley  i'm always looking for games similar to that. only 4 stars because the popups asking to financially support the dev got really annoying.,0
this is good game but some levels cannot be cross. there was a mistake in those levels.  30 and 19 level can't be cross,0
the game is mind numbing with a little challenge to it which is good. badgering for donations constantly to pay for the game is irritating. charge for the game or quite asking...the last update was in may 2016.,0
like it a lot  graphics are fluid and the little bod has a lovely movement. i will pay money maybe when i have played more.,1
great game... i've got only one problem the game needs a view of looking through the doors in the game and needs an aerial view... other than that the game is just awesome!!!,1
it's really a great game  it has great graphics  good levels  cute robot and believe it or not... free. amazing.,1
i completed the game...i felt like it finished very soon.hope you guys will add more levels. more interest obstacles that make the game a little more tough.. good luck guys..,1
this game is so awesome that it can even open the brain of a dull man! its very interesting n children must play it for their iq test. its an offline game n i request the developer of the game to make more levels. thank u,1
"amazing game.. with amazing levels .. thanks ""martin"" for making such a lovely game.. i wish to play many more such exiting games.. and also waiting for new version of mekorama.. sorry.. because i can't contribute enough but.. whatever i paid all for this lovely creation..",1
"favorite game ever.. i played it 3 years ago.. and now i am reinstalling it for a second run.. its only 5 mb  that is the best part.. please make more games like this... why the game has no updates since 2016 ?? ""odd bot out"" too was an amazing game..",1
excellent game  so entertaining  well worth the 3.99 for the premium  the ads just got a little annoying.,0
the best game i have played. great concept. easy game controls. great level difficulty implementation,1
that's the game everyone is looking for.anyone can play this and it's so relaxing to play it there is no need to stree out to complete a level and there is no need for frustration in it.i love it and expecting more levels from it,1
is very cool and satisfactory the music but there's a glitch in the game is in level 11 because if you do something wrong you get out of the puzzle.,0
very nice game i m bored and then i make my levels example mini golf robots home and etc. but that levels that make me have much time . please give a update and give mekorama chapter 2 . and more levels too . martin magni mekorama is the best puzzle game ever,1
great game  high graphics and very enjoyable! you can even make your own card(puzzle/level) the developer in this game i could say to you is that this game you've made is really awesome! great job!,1
the game is exceptionally well done  the challenge of figuring out the next move due to the camera angles is a lot of fun.,1
superb game...a simple but effective game to refresh and sharpen your brain simultaniously...also it comes with a remarkeble small size  that helps every smartphone user to save their memory space...,1
quite amazingly puzzled. good beautiful graphics. easy to play but grows more interest with difficulties.,1
too cute. don't let the static picture fool you into thinking this is some low functioning low resolution game. it's not. it is smooth and detailed.,1
"it was bery addictive.... even sometimes i want to throw my phone because its difficulty. i love the music effects  the animation  and the robot is so cute!. can you tell me why the robot's costume had letter""b""?",1
this game stretched my mind to its limits exploring the deepest caverns of my knowledge. thank you martin magni!!! i love playing because it doesnt need wifi or internet connection because of this i can play anywhere anytime!!!!!,1
this game is insane!! it is pretty good soo far  i like the graphics and all the levels are excellent. the level making section makes the game more interesting love it!,1
the game is really fun and challenging at times. the smooth controls and transitions are really good.,1
really nice game. smooth graphics  increasingly challenging 3d puzzles  satisfying gameplay. just really enjoying this,1
huge respect. the game is just so smooth and relaxing  gameplay is original and flexible. nothing to complain  one of the best. just a question,1
everything is fine except the music and sound effects are stuttery  it's messy but it's not really affecting the gameplay,1
simple  but deceptive. entirely frustrating at some points  but overall a good game. really nice graphics,1
it's an addictive game  very good for brain exercises. it challenges you to be able to think which is pretty awesome...,1
i never go out in my own and quite a review with out being promoted  so take my word,1
good puzzle game.best thing is you can create your own levels. if i would be able i would pay the highest buget available. this is my favourite puzzle game so far.keep going!,1
excellent puzzle game. high quality graphics and a new take on the puzzle style. highly recommended.,1
good game at such low storage nice strategy!! have to use your mind to complete the level which makes you more intelligent in problem solving.,1
i'm 88 and i'm absolutely hooked on mekorama now i've been into gaming all my life i even had a video and computer game shop and this is without doubt the best game i've ever played you keep going back to it thinking i will work that out which is proof of a really great game programme is just brilliant thank you so much keep up the good work len williams in gillingham kent 26.8.21the only thing i keep trying to buy the other levels hints etc but i don't know why it wont accept my visa card sorry,0
such a great game always makes me feel happy when i play it.the app even though being free contains no adds what so ever.the game almost feels neverending as levels get harder as you complete more levels thank you mr.martin magni for making this wonderfull game.....more soundtracks would boost the experience.,1
this game is just brilliant. simple graphics and simple controls. it's different from the other games i have played because this is a simple game that makes you play it over and over again.,1
its a very innovative game though it doesnt look such from an external peek. you would be amazed by how many different unorthodox kinds of paths would be the solutions,1
amazed ! truly amazed by the simple yet authentic seign of the gameplay and each puzzle is actually a quality puzzle to be solved !and believe me i enjoyed ot so much that i have actually complted those 50 card levels more than 3to 4times! congo to the developer for developing such intricate and unique game!,1
it's an awesome  complex thinking game that i had an extremely enjoyably experience playing  definitely recommend it to all that have a hunger for uniform puzzle games,1
the game itself is very enjoyable and the music used in it is really suitable and awesome! playing mekorama is an amazing experience which makes me so happy! thank you for creating this beautiful experience by working on such a game!,1
excellent graphics  nice interface  feeling good all the time  ajd background music is good too..,1
high quality graphics are very rare to find in such a small-sized game. hats off to the developers. please keep creating more games like this.,1
a great game under 10mb. it is totally enjoyable and funny. one can pass his/her time by playing it .one also can make his/her own level too. i like this game most.....,1
a very fun puzzler for all ages. my 5 year old loves this game as much as i do  and builds some pretty complex puzzles.,1
a fun game that takes little memory and there are no ads. not completed yet but it is pretty simple.,1
i love it  its a great puzzle solving game and really gets you thinking and with the make your own level aspect the game is unending,1
this game is actually super fun and peaceful to play. the music is very smoothing and very relaxing. if your looking for something to relax you this is your game.,1
progressive in each level  design is quite unique and if you're into solving challenging puzzles  this is it,1
this game was beautifull simple gameplay  good graphics yet challenging. no disturbing advertisement.,1
one main thing i luv about this game is the smoothness of it. the flow of it makes it soo satisfying to play. the game concept is just outstanding. amazing  yet underated,1
i like the game so much. i love it and it is interesting when making levels by myself. good game. please make the map size unlimited so that we can make a world ..,1
this is the game i was looking for.. it's fun and hard at the same time. more than doing the same thing again and again it helps to think in different perspectives.and i'm adicted to the game now...,1
really liked the game with simple graphics  brain challenging puzzles and really cute robots. enjoying making my own levels,1
the game is masterpiece! it gives you the opportunity to build you own levels and to play community created levels! the graphics are amazing and it is clear that the team did amazing job!,1
enjoyed by young nephew. my 4yo nephew loves the little robot  helping it navigate and finding a path to the goal. he also takes great joy in torturing the red robot by letting it fall in the water or leaving it stranded in an island.,1
i love this game. it is very simple and easy to play. there are ads in game but not many like other games. the ai of the bot is very good. he can find a definite path wherever we point.,1
pretty good game. nice graphics  and requires you to use your brain  buy not so hard you get stuck on every level.,1
great game. great concept. good amount of brain stimulation  love it to the core. best feature - make your own level.,1
best puzzle to play in this pandemic situation. it helped me increase iq  concentration and focus. it is also good for passing time,1
this is the best gaming experience i have ever had on android. it's so clean and smooth with such an interesting gameplay. this is a much underappreciated game on playstore.,1
i don't know if i get angry or laught when the robot go out the level. it's an amazing game whit a relax sound and good puzzles. the only thing that boter me is the automatic camera.,1
the best puzzle game ever. love it. martin magni great job. though i feel it may include more levels or worlds. but overall love it.,1
great simple and fun it's one of a kind game where we can pay what we want and it's light in memory too. best of all the games.plus no ads. the best,1
size doesn't matters. this is the least space eating game and i believe this tops that category. graphics  movements  configuration... everything is realistic.,1
it is very good puzzle game because it's all level are different you won't fill that this is repeating.......and also a very very good graphic...,1
the game is so smooooooth  it is so good  i recommend installing this  the calm music is awesome and the puzzle levels are challenging and rewarding... overall 5/5,1
gorgeous graphic and clever puzzles. it has no ads but it does ask you to make monetary contribution to the designer. i guess it's only fair.,1
nice haha...firstly i think its just easy game but i was wrong. this game is harder than i thought  to finish the puzzle you must think out of the box...for those not install this game yet....install keti..capat...sikapai kopio...aramai kasari maini...buli negidi buat your own puzzle sendiri......,1
not your usual head trainer. like other strategy games found here  it's a trial and error but unlike the others  mekorama also tests your patience and stress management.,1
addictive game that makes you think while having fun. very creative. good graphics and movement. game has a calming affect too.,1
i love it !! it makes my mind to think hard to find solutions that makes me happy . also   i completed the 50 puzzles in three days and started to make my own levels .,1
"love this game. using ai for its control. isometric style make me say ""wow"" immediately. the robot is so cute when it walks. great job! you build up my imajination about game.",1
great puzzle game! a little easy for me  but the graphics and concepts are great!,1
i cannot believe i found this game again.yaaaaaaay i thought i lost it.is there more than 50 cards?that is all i .i hope there are more levels.glow in the dark levels would be cool.please keep this game on google playstore forever i want this game to stay so i can play.i give more than 5  thank you for keeping the game i found it again.and offline to.,1
this game is really relaxing and somehow cute. i love watching the little robot walk around trying to reach the exit. its really fun and entertaining i really recommend.,1
definitely one of the best games i've played. simple yet so nice. love the fact that you can design your own level and how you can choose how much you want to give to the creator,1
amazing game,1
this game i the greatest puzzle game ive ever played but i feel like there shoud be a senstivity setting for moving blocks and/the camera. but do love this game its a great type of 3d maze game.,1
great game  must try once  other than the levels in the game  you can make levels and share them  or either play levels made by others,1
so far really good!just installed today and really loving it.a really great puzzle game and also that mini robotic character is reallyyy cute!!cant wait to explore new levels,1
this game is very nice and decent. the music gives soothing effect to ears . this game uses both your brain and virtual senses or creativity as you have to imagine that you are in there . i love this game,1
mega intertainer the protagonist is silly yeah like he is drunken all the time that makes it funny but i like the gameplay and the variety of imagination. i like the skill of martin magni the developer .he musg have an artistic skilled and vast talent ...thanks for this game.,1
the game is cool  but i feel like many of the puzzles are more focused on being patient than actually solving the puzzle.,1
this is the best puzzle game i've ever played. so sad the newest updated was 4 years ago. i hope you see my review martin because i love playing this game so much like back when i was high school,1
best and super game easy but mazes are cool awesome graphic and design easy to control making the level and playing is more fun.,1
i like how you don't use any ads to make money. i love this game it has a very cute robot and very good puzzles. i can't pay but still i want to support by rating this wonderful app.,1
love this game the music is cool thanks  the graphics  are cool the levels are the best   we can make our own levels l played this game for about 3 days but it all started again l had to play all levels again unfair dude l wasted my 3 days dude so unfair,1
this is the second time i have gone through this game and it was just as fun the second time. fantastic game. graphics are great and it is just challenging enough. one of the best games i have played!,1
it is really a very nice brain exercise game to play at anytime and it's background music is also very soothing. i loved it !!,1
nice puzzles. controls are a bit problematic on some levels but overall a great game!,1
really challenging puzzles with eye soothing graphics. a unique blend of gameplay and graphics i must say.,1
intriguing and challenging level design. makes you think and is very calming. best game i have played so far.,1
this game is awesome! it lets your imagination run wild as well as inspiring others to use their creativity! its fun to make and play puzzling levels in this game so that is why i gave it 5 stars.,1
i love this game vry much bcz it not only gives us levels to play but also the chance to make our own levels . it's so much fun to make our own levels.,1
fun and gets you to think. after the first puzzle  i was thinking this will get old real fast. it was too easy. now i find myself wanting hints,1
it's one the best game i have ever played..thanks to the creator for such a simple but tough game. loved the game for being a stress buster. makes me feel calm..at last  i wanna say that this game is one of it's kind.,1
cutest and most challenging puzzle game i have played. definitely not like the rest. great job devs!,1
i love this game. this is not a adventire game but yes it's a ouzzled game. must try once u r mind will blow up finding the way for bot. u can also build u r own level with ouzzle and also u can share it with freinds and give them a try to solve it.,1
perfect balance of fun and puzzling! the little robot guy is cute and each puzzle works my brain in a different way. absolutely love it,1
it was a fun and super interesting game!! i would really suggest it for anyone. the music and sound effects are really peaceful too!! loved it,1
if you like monument valley  give this a go. it's not quite the same  but the relaxing atmosphere and puzzle gameplay bring back the kind of feeling mv had.,1
thank you martin magni  i really loved this game. it's a puzzled 3d game a lot of entertainment. also you can make your own puzzles and share with your friends. good job!,1
simple gameplay but great fun if you like puzzles. some of the levels still elude me.,1
this game will expand a child's spatial intelligence and logic in solving 3-dimensional puzzles. i highly recommend it.,1
game is amazing  but upmill battle is broken. robot turn right does not go through the doorway and spins around in an infinite loop.,0
this is definitely an excellent game. but it has to improve a bit more to earn its 5th star. some levels of this game requires some specific camera angle. but i don't get them,1
it is the best game that i played ever . it is the best game that is playable easily . the graphic of this game is so fluent and fine .the developer is good for making easy and mind logical game . it is the game that you play but not like addict . it some part are addictable.,1
very nice game i feel so happy to play this game there are many levels in this game and some are difficult summer easy but it is interesting every level is interesting you will feel so happy to play this game right at least tried once,1

this game is unbelievably amazing. good controls. amazing graphics. relaxing soundtracks.,1
delightfully innovative  getting more challenging as you go on  but also more interesting. kudos for the developer!,1
i give it four...it's a great game... awesome graphics but there are no instructions to guide you and in build mode u can't even do anything......,1
it's a very excellent game in this format. and one thing is very surprise for me i make our many puzzle in this game. it's a low mb offline puzzle game. so why are you waiting . just download it.,1
such wonderful puzzles & so beautiful to look at & the little robot so cute & full of personality. now i'm spoiled forever  i can't find another game that measures up!!,1
a good logic based game  the levels are well thought and made  gradually the toughness inc  it's nice and brain tingling. good job and congrats to the developer and the team.,1
it was fun playing it but it is just so sad that it only contains 50 stages +25 master stages it took me only 1 hour to finish it so i tried improve i want to give it 4 stars but 5 is better for mr. matin magini i hope you create more levels in this game and improve the character .may you create more games like this.,1
i loved this game. the graphics is good the gameplay is simple and straight forward. the puzzles are amazing,1
a brilliant puzzle game -- this is a fantastic and enjoyable game that will make you think  and think outside the box  too!! very highly recommended!! ,1
beautiful game for almost all ages including my 5 year can play with little assistance. i can recommend for everyone to try it. great work to the creator.,1
superb and cute game. dont get too confident. it may seems easy at first but as you progress it be more challenging. really good to play during those free time,1
this is the best game but a problem is that you can't pass many levels and sometimes even the things that they are telling us to do . but overall in other things it's the best game,1
this game is great but it's missing some options features. there is no way to turn off the music or sound effects.,0
its an awesome games mind grooming game which is totally addless their are no adds poping up in this game which is more happening for me try it for free its worth it and it takes very less storage,1
great thinking game. nice graphics and great mechanics. best puzzle  thinking game in the store at this moment.,1
a great time killer and brain teaser game. also  the graphics is great and relaxing.,1
amazing graphics despite the low space taken. addictive and brain teasing. the perfect game! bravo!,1
this game is small but very powerful  each level of this game is challenging and interesting. i am giving five star not only for game but also for developers talent. very good.,1
amazing it has eazy levels that get harder and are challenging building can be hard but when you finish the level it's worth it,1
its quite interesting how it makes me think a lot. its not hard per say   but it definitely making my patience to work with. i like how i can make my own n share it with people too... kinda make me wonder how to be creative enough for this game too...,1
great fun game to pass by the time and makes you think. finished all the levels. only shame that there arent more!! would love more levels!!,1
best game ever. no ads  no fragmented game experience! you decide how much you pay for it  which means you can pay nothing  up to you.,1
pretty good game and puzzles. i thought it was too easy at first until i got stuck. no ad's good fun and passes the time by nicely.,1
it is very relaxing game. the best part is making our own levels but i think that all levels should be open at once,1
very interesting puzzle game  simple and high quality graphics   quite addictive  i would highly recoomend this game if anyone is searching for puzzle game...,1
one of the best game too get rid of boring lectures just gear up with controls and then its just perfect..,1
actually i would give 1 out of 5. i give 3++ for graphics  that's almost 4. and one for asking pay   give support to developers   etc. i finished my 50 cards - thank you - had fun - good job. simply said.,1
nice game it challenges our mind but im very sad that i can't pay.but i request the people who can pay please pay as this game is very beautiful and i try to make the levels by my own but it takes 2 to3 days and also has some mistakes so please pay and it is a very good game,1
great graphics  imponderable gameplay. send you into buildings so you can't even see where you're going. idiotic.,0
the gameplay is challenging and the fact that u can create ur own puzzles makes it outstanding  love it alot.,1
this game is perfect for anyone who loves puzzle games. it is challenging  but still solvable. it looks cute too,1
nice game. some parts can be challenging but not impossible. the music is calming and the robot is so cute.,1
simple  small sized  best puzzle game ... plus you can also make your own levels which is super fun or play other user made levels by scanning their or code,1
it was good this is the first geniune review im writing about a game  i love this game this game is addicting and you get to choose how much you pay or even play for free and even if you play it for free its not constatly shoving ads down my throat and the game is very instresting as well attention catching highly recommend it,1
this is a well designed  fun game. the graphics are flawless and quite stylish. the game play is straightforward and easy to use.,1
fun spacial puzzle game. some are quite straight forward  but others take some work to puzzle out.,0
really enjoyed the game  and love when you finish a hard level and then the name of the level hits you.,1
it's adorable. i love the art style and the character movements. the levels are nicely puzzled.,1
i give it four stars because it's a amazing game i have been playing for about a week and the levels are really well made   i am having so much fun playing this in my free time . but i don't get hits   it says i have to pay for it...,1
unique puzzle game. pretty easy so far  but still really fun. i liked the double layer maze.,1
one of its kind! i can't believe i've played such an epic game. i don't know how many nights had martin spent in making this game.its only 5.4 mb! such cool graphics and controls! 50 levels of insanity !,1
i love the game it small in but have great graphics and allows you to make your own levels.,1
great interactive puzzles with moderate difficulty and it even has the option to build puzzles which is also a fun experience,1
it's a really good game  me and my friends passed the all level without any tips and enjoyed the game. my frends also enjoyed this game ...the robot was very cute.all levels are interesting and harder.i feel happy because i passed all the levels,1
nice graphics great idea and a very good implementation the custom levels make it much more enjoyable best thing is it's free and doesn't contain any ads,1
it's really an interesting game. the developer has created really amazing puzzles to solve.i think everyone should try it.,1
the best game i've played so far. i love the the design of puzzles and the robot. the robot is super cute! highly recommend!,1
used to play this all the time with my 6-7 year old  then my phone broke. just came across it again  and my son is 9 yrs old now  and we both still love it! thank you!,1
wonderful and challenging game all the levels are challenging. special mentions for level 29 'open sesame' was incredible level 46 'sarlacc pit' was out of my imagination,1
hi dear developer. your game is cool and fun to play. but could you please adjust the way we view the obstacles like making it 360 degrees. not just sideways. thank you dear developer,1
one of the best puzzle game although might be confusing and very time sensitive at later levels.,1
really beautifully designed game.... boosts up your problem solving skill ( i think so).....very nice and tricky game. need your full attention while you are playing it,1
lovely graphics  simple but fun gameplay and a cute little robot thing to play as. amazing game all round.,1
great game. lots of fun. some levels are quite straightforward others are feindishly difficult to work out.,1
it's awesome game... the complete exercise of brain.. i wish it would come to my knowledge in the lockdown days. one question.. why the hints are not available for free,0
the game is good  in some stages it is difficult and challenging. it's recommended for puzzle games,1
it's a simple game in terms of presentation but the puzzles are fun and intelligent. great game,1
a really liked this game a lot!! i completed the game in three weeks it was hard but i did it . and i need more levels as soon as possible...very fun and enjoyable game !!,1
this is an amazing mind blowing game with lots of puzzling levels and if thatbis not enough you can create you own. check it out. thanks to the developers.,1
the simplicity of this game is top notch and u can even make ur own notes in every stage!! how awesome one can innovate their art is mind boggling!!! thanks for making this game mate,1
the game is good...liked it but you should keep few hints for free...and you also need to give game poitns...as the level 19 is so tough we need to see the hints but the hints are paid so please keep some hints for free...or make game poitns which me help during games,0
this game is cool! the puzzle  the graphic  the character and other stuff is amazing!!! and always make me laugh everytime i died and yeah love this game! ,1
i wish there was an option to disable bgm. i couldn't play because the music sounds glitched and gives me terrible anxiety.,0
excellant game......the concept is simple yet challenging ...... the game is spotless till now...full marks....would add recommendation after completion,1
simply wonderfull. keeping brain engaged. loved it. crossed all level. eagerly waiting for the new challenging levels.,1
loved the concept and the simplicity is its greatest plus point. addictive and lovable and the thing of editing our own level is what makes me play this game more further...,1
great game  but there should be a fast mode or less time consuming mode in which the robot appears where pressed cuz it takes up a lot of time sometimes,0
the app is really good. it doesn't lag. no ads. levels are awesome. a level passed feels like you're a little less of a disappointment to your family.,1
super awesome concept  nice graphics  crazy animations  but we can rotate only on x axis if we can rotate y axis too  it will be better....,0
very exiciting game.but the control is little bit problematic the graphics always facing in a certain angle otherwise very addictive game.,0
honesty  an amazing game. the graphics are quiet good  for a puzzle game of this kind. it pushes ur mind well enough to enjoy it.,1

such an amazing game with beautiful & very impressive graphics at such low mb. i gotta say this is 'the' best classic game i ever played. really exciting & funny game. kudos to the developers.,1
physics are too slippery and the ai seems to be weak  most of the time the robot just falls off over simple things like walking over another robot or standing on a moving block.,1
camera controls can be a little annoying at times but it is a super fun  relaxing puzzle game,1
i like the game.it is fun and awesome.sometimes the levels can be puzzle but as for me i can think out the solution just in a sec.i give this game 5 stars because it reminds me of captain toad on the nintendo wii u,1
noice game good puzzles  but the level editor could do with a tutorial explaining how to use it properly.,1
one of the best games i have played. would appreciate addition of some new blocks to build which can promote new mechanics to play.,1
its the cutest game and so so so lovely game amazing mind blowing i hope it has infinite level thank you so much. graphics n controls all are superb.,1

so nice game. it needs both time and brain. i just love to play it. there are master cards which are quite hard.,0
i love how the levels are simple yet you have to put thought into them  then the complicated ones have the easiest solution.,0
very good game but please add a feature of ending the game when you are zapped  i want to create a surving game; you are in a place with zapped bots and in the other side  a robot is in his way to the win.but when you are zapped the other robot continues his trip and you can easily win...,0
for a long time i was thinking that should i download it or not i thought it is a vr and a building game so i thought no but then i thought let finally download it after playing sometime i got to know that it is a very nice game and creative also i really liked it.,0
the game was really awesome low on mbs but high graphics make more games like mekoram but in different places and defrent actors'you now this is my first time giving a game 4stars i usually give all games 3 star because of mbs and graphics you are the first people to be give 4stars by me make more games like that but with vehicles and others,0

super game  super graphics  super &simple music. n the robot is really soo cute  specially the way he walks. its like a small baby .,1
the game is good but it happens that the robot clips outside of the playing area to walk outside of bounds. is that a bug or placed on purpose?,1

its an amazing creative game but the controls not so much and theres only low amount of blocks maybe add more to make it more colorful and alot creative,1
i love this game but i think it needs to spice up a little bit. i think it needs multiplayer and dinffrent colors like green pink blue and yellow.,1
a light simple and brilliant game. this game is ideal for anyone who wants to work on their logical or cognitive abilities.,1
great puzzle game  very unique. player can make their own level n share it with each other.,1
lovely game. very relaxing and visually cute puzzle game. such a pleasant surprise to play a game where adverts and premium currency are not rammed down your throat.,1
it is the best that puzzle games has to offer in less than 6 mb you get beautiful and clean graphics and challenging levels. one of the best time killer,1

i hope you may make another game but it's better from all games and we wish that you can do it in mekorama there is very simple equation and also very difficult solution which make a time of an 5 min by the way i like mmekorama it's not have much mb like another i like it thanks for this game,1

can't help but mention a favorable comparison to monument valley. it has similar game play  but different enough to make it all shiny new for me. i like it.,1

i like it cz it's a unique puzzle game. only 1 thing i don't like it's background music.... it makes me irritate... i suggest to put some melody music,1
good game like monument valley but in this game you stuck sometimes and you need hints to end the level. it's entertaining and puzzle game.,1
"i like it a lot. very simple control and very good brain exercise. the ""build own maze "" idea and then qr code sharing is even more awesome",1
its an awesome game and the option to create your own level is something new which cant be seen in any of the game its intresting it also aquires less space and i liked this game,1
